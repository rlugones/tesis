Turbulence is an ubiquitous phenomenon in the universe, observed in
scenarios such as neutral fluids on Earth, and also in situations like
charged fluids in space. At the same time, plasma represents more than
99\% of visible matter. Despite being so common, plasma turbulence is
extremely complex and complicated to study, since besides the
difficulties of a neutral flow (non-linear interaction in the
Navier-Stokes equation, predominantly), it is added the interaction
with electromagnetic fields, self-generated or external, by coupling
with Maxwell's equations.

Among all existing models, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, which
treats plasma as a single fluid, is used as a model for a wide range
of astrophysical and space physics applications. The main reason to
this is that, despite its (relative) simplicity, this model adequately
captures both the macroscopic behavior and the energy cascade from the
large scales to the dissipation scale.

In this thesis we study, through direct 3D numerical simulations, some
of the fundamental aspects of MHD turbulence, such as the spectral
transfer of energy and the multiplicity of temporal scales present,
both in the isotropic case and in anisotropic cases. We analyze the
spatio-temporal behavior of the magnetic fields and velocities by
studying the energy spectrum and the decorrelation times, for cases
with null, small, medium and large mean magnetic field. This allows us
to distinguish the dominant physical effect in a wide variety of
situations.

We also analyze the spatio-temporal spectra of the Els\"sser fields,
independently varying the mean magnetic field and the cross
helicity. In addition to allowing us to distinguish the dominant
effect, we observe counterpropagation of Alf\'enic fluctuations due to
reflections produced by inhomogeneities in the total magnetic field.

% Magnetohydrodynamic 共MHD兲 turbulence has been employed as a physical model for a wide range of
% applications in astrophysical and space plasma physics. This Colloquium reviews fundamental aspects
% of MHD turbulence, including spectral energy transfer, nonlocality, and anisotropy, each of which is
% related to the multiplicity of dynamical time scales that may be present. These basic issues are
% discussed based on the concepts of sweeping of the small scales by a large-scale field, which in MHD
% occurs due to effects of counterpropagating waves, as well as the local straining processes that occur
% due to nonlinear couplings. These considerations give rise to various expected energy spectra, which
% are compared to both simulation results and relevant observations from space and astrophysical
% plasmas.

% Mininni:
% This article reviews recent studies of scale interactions in magnetohydro-
% dynamic turbulence. The present-day increase of computing power, which
% allows for the exploration of different configurations of turbulence in con-
% ducting flows, and the development of shell-to-shell transfer functions, has
% led to detailed studies of interactions between the velocity and the magnetic
% field and between scales. In particular, processes such as induction and dy-
% namo action, the damping of velocity fluctuations by the Lorentz force, and
% the development of anisotropies can be characterized at different scales. In
% this context we consider three different configurations often studied in the
% literature: mechanically forced turbulence, freely decaying turbulence, and
% turbulence in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. Each configuration is
% of interest for different geophysical and astrophysical applications. Local and
% nonlocal transfers are discussed for each case. Whereas the transfer between
% scales of solely kinetic or solely magnetic energy is local, transfers between
% kinetic and magnetic fields are observed to be local or nonlocal depending
% on the configuration. Scale interactions in the cascade of magnetic helicity
% are also reviewed. Based on the results, the validity of several usual assump-
% tions in hydrodynamic turbulence, such as isotropy of the small scales or
% universality, is discussed.

% Using direct numerical simulations of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
% turbulence the spatio-temporal behavior of magnetic field
% fluctuations is analyzed.Cases with relatively small, medium and
% large values of a mean background magnetic field are considered. The
% (wavenumber) scale dependent time correlation function is directly
% computed for different simulations, varying the mean magnetic field
% value. From this correlation function the time decorrelation is
% computed and compared with different theoretical times, namely,
% the local non-linear time, the random sweeping time, and the
% Alfv\'enic time, the latter being a wave effect. It is observed that
% time decorrelations are dominated by sweeping effects, and only at
% large values of the mean magnetic field and for wave vectors mainly
% aligned with this field time decorrelations are controlled by
% Alfv\'enic effects.


% P2:
% We study the spatio-temporal behavior of the Els\"asser variables
% describing magnetic and velocity field fluctuations, using direct
% numerical simulations of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
% turbulence. We consider cases with relatively small, intermediate,
% and large values of a mean background magnetic field, and with null,
% small, and high cross-helicity (correlations between the velocity
% and the magnetic field). Wavenumber-dependent time correlation
% functions are computed for the different simulations. From these
% correlation functions, the decorrelation time is computed and
% compared with different theoretical characteristic times: the local
% non-linear time, the random-sweeping time, and the Alfv\'enic
% time. It is found that decorrelation times are dominated by sweeping
% effects for low values of the mean magnetic field and for low values
% of the cross-helicity, while for large values of the background
% field or of the cross-helicity and for wave vectors sufficiently
% aligned with the guide field, decorrelation times are controlled by
% Alfv\'enic effects. Finally, we observe counter-propagation of
% Alfv\'enic fluctuations due to reflections produced by
% inhomogeneities in the total magnetic field. This effect becomes
% more prominent in flows with large cross-helicity, strongly
% modifying the propagation of waves in turbulent magnetohydrodynamic
% flows.
