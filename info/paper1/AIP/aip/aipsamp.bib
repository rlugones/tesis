  abstract = {The sharp magnetic discontinuities that naturally appear in solar

	associated with intense currents. Parker proposed that these currents
	can become unstable to a variety of microscopic processes, with the
	net result of dramatically enhanced resistivity and heating (nano-flares).
	The electric fields associated with such "hot spots" are also expected
	to enhance particle acceleration. We test this hypothesis by exact
	relativistic orbit simulations in strong random phase magnetohydrodynamic
	turbulence that is forming localized super-Dreicer Ohm electric fields
	(10 2 ≤ E Ω / E D ≤ 10 5 ) occurring in 2%-15% of the volume. It
	is found that these fields indeed yield a large amplification of
	acceleration of electrons and ions and can effectively overcome the
	injection problem. We suggest in this article that nanoflare heating
	will be associated with sporadic particle acceleration.},

  abstract = {The ever increasing processing capabilities of the supercomputers

	for higher and higher resolution computational grids, has resulted
	in deluges of simulation data. Yet the computational resources and
	tools required to make sense of these vast numerical outputs through

	of the data a painstaking, if not a hopeless, task. In this paper,
	we describe a new tool for the scientific investigation of massive
	computational datasets. This tool (VAPOR) employs data reduction,
	advanced visualization, and quantitative analysis operations to permit
	the interactive exploration of vast datasets using only a desktop
	PC equipped with a commodity graphics card. We describe VAPORs use
	in the study of two problems. The first, motivated by stellar envelope
	convection, investigates the hydrodynamic stability of compressible
	thermal starting plumes as they descend through a stratified layer
	of increasing density with depth. The second looks at current sheet
	formation in an incompressible helical magnetohydrodynamic flow to
	understand the early spontaneous development of quasi two-dimensional
	(2D) structures embedded within the 3D solution. Both of the problems
	were studied at sufficiently high spatial resolution, a grid of 504

	over a broad range of scales and energies. High-energy particles
	are usually detected in concomitance with large energy release events

	at smaller scales, characterized by dynamical activity near current
	sheets. To gain insight into the complex scenario of coronal charged
	particle acceleration, we investigate the properties of acceleration
	with a test-particle approach using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
	(MHD) models. These are obtained from direct solutions of the reduced
	MHD equations, well suited for a plasma embedded in a strong axial
	magnetic field, relevant to the inner heliosphere. A multi-box, multiscale
	technique is used to solve the equations of motion for protons. This
	method allows us to resolve an extended range of scales present in
	the system, namely, from the ion inertial scale of the order of a
	meter up to macroscopic scales of the order of 10 km (1/100th of
	the outer scale of the system). This new technique is useful to identify
	the mechanisms that, acting at different scales, are responsible
	for acceleration to high energies of a small fraction of the particles

	plasma waves and/or velocity space instabilities. We focus on plasma
	parameters similar to those found in the near-Earth solar wind, though
	most of our results are more broadly applicable. An important control
	parameter is the size of the particle mean free path λ mfp relative
	to the scale of the turbulent fluctuations L . For small scattering
	rates, particles interact quasi-resonantly with turbulent fluctuations
	in magnetic field strength. Scattering increases the long-term efficiency
	of this resonant heating by factors of a few times 10, but the distribution
	function does not develop a significant non-thermal power-law tail.
	For higher scattering rates, the interaction between particles and
	turbulent fluctuations becomes non-resonant, governed by particles
	heating and cooling adiabatically as they encounter turbulent density
	fluctuations. Rapid pitch-angle scattering can produce a power-law
	tail in the proton distribution function, but this requires fine-tuning
