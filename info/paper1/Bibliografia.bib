	abstract = {This textbook presents a modern account of turbulence, one of the greatest challenges in physics. The state-of-the-art is put into historical perspective five centuries after the first studies of Leonardo and half a century after the first attempt by A.N. Kolmogorov to predict the properties of flow at very high Reynolds numbers. Such "fully developed turbulence" is ubiquitous in both cosmical and natural environments, in engineering applications and in everyday life. First, a qualitative introduction is given to bring out the need for a probabilistic description of what is in essence a deterministic system. Kolmogorov's 1941 theory is presented in a novel fashion with emphasis on symmetries (including scaling transformations) which are broken by the mechanisms producing the turbulence and restored by the chaotic character of the cascade to small scales. Considerable material is devoted to intermittency, the clumpiness of small-scale activity, which has led to the development of fractal and multifractal models. Such models, pioneered by B. Mandelbrot, have applications in numerous fields besides turbulence (diffusion limited aggregation, solid-earth geophysics, attractors of dynamical systems, etc). The final chapter contains an introduction to analytic theories of the sort pioneered by R. Kraichnan, to the modern theory of eddy transport and renormalization and to recent developments in the statistical theory of two-dimensional turbulence. The book concludes with a guide to further reading. The intended readership for the book ranges from first-year graduate students in mathematics, physics, astrophysics, geosciences and engineering, to professional scientists and engineers.},

We present, for the first time, direct evidence of such a transition using a decaying three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of incompressible balanced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with a grid resolution of 30722{\texttimes}256. From large to small scales, the change of regime is characterized by (i) a change of slope in the energy spectrum going from approximately -2 to -3/2, (ii) an increase of the ratio between the wave and nonlinear times, with a critical ratio of $\chi$c\~{}1/3, (iii) a modification of the isocontours of energy revealing a transition from a purely perpendicular cascade to a cascade compatible with the critical-balance-type phenomenology, and (iv) an absence followed by a dramatic increase of the communication between Alfv{\'e}n modes. The changes happen at approximately the same transition scale and can be seen as manifest signatures of the transition from weak to strong wave turbulence. Furthermore, we observe a significant nonlocal three-wave coupling between strongly and weakly nonlinear modes resulting in an inverse transfer of energy from small to large scales.},

In slow solar wind, the decorrelation time is 215 {\textpm} 43 min, and in fast solar wind, the decorrelation time scale is 114 {\textpm} 23 min, which indicates that decorrelation times vary with the nature of the turbulence. The values reported here are comparable to estimates of decorrelation times based on a number of different models, but do not clearly support or refute any specific solar wind turbulence model.

	abstract = {To understand the turbulent generation of large-scale magnetic fields and to advance beyond purely kinematic approaches to the dynamo effect like that introduced by Steenbeck, Krause \& Radler (1966){\textquoteright} a new nonlinear theory is developed for three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible MHD turbulence with helicity, i.e. not statistically invariant under plane reflexions. For this, techniques introduced for ordinary turbulence in recent years by Kraichnan (1971 a){\textquoteright} Orszag (1970, 1976) and others are generalized to MHD; in particular we make use of the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian approximation. The resulting closed equations for the evolution of the kinetic and magnetic energy and helicity spectra are studied both theoretically and numerically in situations with high Reynolds number and unit magnetic Prandtl number.Interactions between widely separated scales are much more important than for non-magnetic turbulence. Large-scale magnetic energy brings to equipartition small-scale kinetic and magnetic excitation (energy or helicity) by the {\textquoteleft}Alfv{\'e}n effect{\textquoteright}; the small-scale {\textquoteleft}residual{\textquoteright} helicity, which is the difference between a purely kinetic and a purely magnetic helical term, induces growth of large-scale magnetic energy and helicity by the {\textquoteleft}helicity effect{\textquoteright}. In the absence of helicity an inertial range occurs with a cascade of energy to small scales; to lowest order it is a -3/2 power law with equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energy spectra as in Kraichnan (1965) but there are -2 corrections (and possibly higher ones) leading to a slight excess of magnetic energy. When kinetic energy is continuously injected, an initial seed of magnetic field will grow to approximate equipartition, at least in the small scales. If in addition kinetic helicity is injected, an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is obtained leading to the appearance of magnetic energy and helicity in ever-increasing scales (in fact, limited by the size of the system). This inverse cascade, predicted by Frisch et al. (1975), results from a competition between the helicity and Alf{\'e}h effects and yields an inertial range with approximately {\textemdash} 1 and {\textemdash} 2 power laws for magnetic energy and helicity. When kinetic helicity is injected at the scale linj and the rate \${\textbackslash}tilde{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}V\$ (per unit mass), the time of build-up of magnetic energy with scale L >> linj is \$t {\textbackslash}approx L({\textbar}{\textbackslash}tilde{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}V{\textbar}l{\textasciicircum}2\_{\textbackslash}rm inj){\textasciicircum}-1/3.\$},

	abstract = {A recapitulation is first given of a recent theory of homogeneous turbulence based on the condition that the Fourier amplitudes of the velocity field be as randomly distributed as the dynamical equations permit. This theory involves the average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes and employs a new kind of perturbation method which yields what are belived to be exact expansions of third- and higher-order statistical moments of the Fourier amplitudes in terms of second-order moments and these response functions.In the present paper the theory is applied in lowest approximation (called the direct-interaction approximation) to stationary isotropic turbulence of very high Reynolds number. The characteristic wave-number \$k\_0 = {\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbar}v{\textasciicircum}3\_0\$ and Reynolds number \$R\_0 = v\_0 k{\textasciicircum}-1\_0 {\textbar}v\$ where v0 is the r.m.s. velocity in any given direction, $\varepsilon$ is the power dissipated per unit mass, and $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, are introduced. For \$R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac 13\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1\$ it is found that the inertial and dissipation ranges extend over wave-numbers k satisfying k0 << k << R0k0. The time-correlation and average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes in these ranges are evaluated. They are found to be asymptotically identical and given by J1(2v0k$\tau$)/v0k$\tau$, where $\tau$ is the time interval.The energy spectrum in these ranges is determined by a non-linear integral equation, involving the time-correlation and response functions, which is suitable for solution by iteration. The solution is of the form E(k)/v0v = (k/kd) \${\textasciicircum}- {\textbackslash}frac 3 2\$ f(k/kd), where E(k) is the three-dimensional spectrum function \$k\_d = R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac 23\_0 k\_0\$ is a wave-number characterizing the dissipation range, and f(k/kd) is a universal function. In the inertial range, E(k) = f(0) ($\varepsilon$ V0){\textonehalf} \$ k{\textasciicircum}- {\textbackslash}frac 3 2\$, asymptotically. Theparameter f(0) can be obtained by quadratures, without solving the integral equation for E(k). Spectral energy transport throughout the inertial and dissipation ranges is found to proceed by a cascade process essentially local in wave-number space; the direct power delivered by all modes below k to all modes above k' >> k is of order $\varepsilon$(k/k')\$ {\textasciicircum} {\textbackslash}frac 3 2\$ if k and k' both lie within the inertial range. The mean-square velocity derivatives of all orders are found to be finite. For \$R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac 13\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1\$ the skewness factor of the distribution of the nth-order longitudinal velocity derivative is found to have the asymptotic form \$A\_n R{\textasciicircum}-{\textbackslash}frac 16\_0\$ where An is a universal constant.The theory is compared with experiment and is found to be slightly better supported than the Kolmogorov theory. However, it is stressed that extreme caution must be exercised in interpreting the experimental evidence as support for either theory.An analysis is given of the relations between the Kolmogorov theory, Heisen-berg's heuristic theory, the analytical theories of Heisenberg and Chandrasekhar, the theories of Proudman \& Reid and Tatsumi, and the present theory.},

In this paper, we review some recent results in the study of locality of interactions in turbulent flows and we address some of the questions that arise. We examine the cascade of ideal invariants in turbulent MHD flows by examining the transfer functions. We show new results indicating that the nonlocal behaviour of the energy transfer in MHD is the result of a correlation between the velocity and magnetic fields. This nonlocality disappears if we randomize the phases of the two fields keeping the hydrodynamic and magnetic helicities fixed. The cascade of magnetic helicity is also investigated, with special focus on the fate of the small-scale helicity and its coupling with the large-scale flow. These results have implications for dynamo action, in particular for the commonly used distinction between large- and small-scale dynamos. The long-range interactions that exist in MHD flows also raise the question of the existence of universality in MHD, both in the kinematic dynamo regime as well as in the turbulent steady state.},

Turbulence is the archetypal non-linear, non-equilibrium problem of statistical physics; the fundamental problems of turbulence are still unsolved, but there is a growing interest in their solution. This book aims to look at fluid turbulence from the point of view of engineering science and physics to produce an integrated treatise on the nature of the physics of fluid turbulence as a universal phenomenon with a universal behaviour. It is designed for those who are new to the subject and also for those familiar with the more traditional branches of the study of turbulence but not with the usages of quantum physics. For the first group of readers, a concise summary of the theory and practice of turbulence up to about 1960 is given as an introduction. This is followed by a detailed analysis of modern (post 1960) turbulence theory, including rigorous formulation of the turbulence problem as an example of a non-equilibrium statistical system with strong coupling and the application of renormalized perturbation theory to turbulence.},

After reviewing the properties which make spectral (Galerkin) and pseudospectral methods particularly useful for incompressible turbulence simulations, we consider how well these methods carry over to the compressible case. Major obstacles exist in formulating algorithms using the Galerkin method. In spite of the presence of aliasing errors, the pseudospectral method can be used to write algorithms that conserve a number of important global quantities. Accordingly, we suggest pseudospectral forms for a polytropic MHD model. Finally, a pseudospectral algorithm for the ideal gas MHD model is suggested. This algorithm conserves energy in terms of the dynamical fluid variables and not, as is common practice, due to a separate energy equation written in conservative form.},

However, for modes for which the period of the inertial waves $\tau$$\omega$ is faster than the turnover time $\tau$ NL , a significant fraction of the remaining energy is concentrated in the modes that satisfy the dispersion relation of the waves. No evidence of accumulation of energy in the modes with $\tau$ $\omega$ = $\tau$ NL is observed, unlike what critical balance arguments predict. From the time correlation functions, we find that for modes with $\tau$ $\omega$ \&lt; $\tau$ sw (with $\tau$ sw the sweeping time) the dominant decorrelation time is the wave period, and that these modes also show a slower modulation on the timescale $\tau$ NL as assumed in wave turbulence theories. The rest of the modes are decorrelated with the sweeping time, including the very energetic modes with $\omega$ ? 0.},

	abstract = {We study weak Alfvenic turbulence of an incompressible, magnetized fluid in some detail, with a view to developing a firm theoretical basis for the dynamics of small-scale turbulence in the interstellar medium. We prove that resonant 3-wave interactions are absent. We also show that the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan theory of incompressible, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence -- which is widely accepted -- describes weak 3-wave
turbulence; consequently, it is incorrect. Physical arguments, as well as detailed calculations of the coupling coefficients are used to demonstrate that these interactions are empty. We then examine resonant 4-wave interactions, and show that the resonance relations forbid energy transport to small spatial scales along the direction of the mean magnetic field, for both the shear Alfven wave and the pseudo Alfven wave. The three-dimensional inertial-range energy spectrum of 4-wave shear Alfven turbulence guessed from physical arguments reads
E(kz, kperpendicular) approximately
VAvLL-1/3kperpendicular-10/3, where VA is the Alfven speed, and vL is the velocity difference across the outer scale L. Given this spectrum, the velocity difference across lambdaperpendicular approximately kperpendicular exp -1 is vlambda (sub
perpendicular) is approximately
vL(lambdaperpendicular/L)2/3. We derive a kinetic equation, and prove that this energy spectrum is a stationary solution and that it implies a positive flux of energy in k-space, along directions perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Using this energy spectrum, we deduce that 4-wave interactions strengthen as the energy cascades to small, perpendicular spatial scales; beyond an upper bound in perpendicular wavenumber, kperpendicularL is approximately (VA/vL)3/2, weak turbulence theory ceases to be valid. Energy excitation amplitudes must be very small for the 4-wave inertial-range to be substantial. When the excitation is strong, the width of the 4-wave inertial-range shrinks to zero. This seems likely to be the case in the interstellar medium.},

For large values of the constant magnetic field, the total-energy transfer appears to be most dominant in the direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. The linear transfer due to the constant magnetic also appears to be important in redistributing the energy between the velocity and the magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {Tennekes [J. Fluid Mech. 6 7, 561 (1975)] estimated the time decorrelation of inertial-range excitation in isotropic turbulence by assuming effective statistical independence of the one-time distributions of inertial-range and energy-range excitation. This picture has been challenged by Yakhot, Orszag, and She [Phys. Fluids A 1, 184 (1989)], who studied forced turbulence by renormalization-group (RNG) methods. The analysis given in the present paper leads to the conclusion that (a) precise coherence between energy-range and inertial-range excitation is needed to inhibit sweeping effects; (b) in the case of randomly forced turbulence, this coherence is impossible and Tennekes{\textquoteright} picture is unavoidable; and (c) the RNG analysis does not demonstrate inhibition of sweeping; instead, it discards sweeping effects at the outset. To augment the present study, an advected passive scalar is examined by computer simulation. Sweeping effects on small scales survive even in the case of long-time advection by a frozen velocity field. The observed probability distributions resemble those for the alignment of vorticity and velocity observed in flow simulations.},

	abstract = {We investigate the locality or nonlocality of the energy transfer and the spectral interactions involved in the cascade for decaying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows in the presence of a uniform magnetic field B at various intensities. The results are based on a detailed analysis of three-dimensional numerical flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. The energy transfer functions, as well as the global and partial fluxes, are examined by means of different geometrical wave number shells. On the one hand, the transfer functions of the two conserved Els{\"a}sser energies E+ and E- are found local in both the directions parallel (k{\textbardbl} direction) and perpendicular (k? direction) to the magnetic guide field, whatever the B strength. On the other hand, from the flux analysis, the interactions between the two counterpropagating Els{\"a}sser waves become nonlocal. Indeed, as the B intensity is increased, local interactions are strongly decreased and the interactions with small k{\textbardbl} modes dominate the cascade. Most of the energy flux in the k? direction is due to modes in the plane at k{\textbardbl}=0, while the weaker cascade in the k{\textbardbl} direction is due to the modes with k{\textbardbl}=1. The stronger magnetized flows tend thus to get closer to the weak turbulence limit, where three-wave resonant interactions are dominant. Hence, the transition from the strong to the weak turbulence regime occurs by reducing the number of effective modes in the energy cascade.},

Recent observations from Yohkoh and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and a reanalysis of older observations from the Solar Maximum Mission, have led to important new results concerning the location, timing, and efficiency of particle acceleration in flares. These are summarized in the first part of the review. Particle acceleration processes are then discussed, with particular emphasis on new developments in stochastic acceleration by magnetohydrodynamic waves and direct electric field acceleration by both sub- and super-Dreicer electric fields. Finally, issues that arise when these mechanisms are incorporated into the large-scale flare structure are considered. Stochastic and super-Dreicer acceleration may occur either in a single large coronal reconnection site or at multiple {\textquotedblleft}fragmented{\textquotedblright} energy release sites. Sub-Dreicer acceleration requires a highly filamented coronal current pattern. A particular issue that needs to be confronted by all theories is the apparent need for large magnetic field strengths in the flare energy release region.},

At leading order, this asymptotic regime is achieved via three-wave resonant interactions with the scattering of a wave on a 2D mode for which \$k\_{\textbackslash}Vert =0\$ . When the interactions with the 2D modes are artificially reduced, we show numerically that the system exhibits an energy spectrum with \$k\_{\textbackslash}bot {\textasciicircum}-3/2\$ , whereas the expected exact solution with \$k\_{\textbackslash}bot {\textasciicircum}-2\$ is recovered with the full nonlinear system. In the latter case, strong intermittency is found when the vector separation of structure functions is taken transverse to \${\textbackslash}boldsymbolb\_{\textbackslash}mathbf0\$ . This result may be explained by the influence of the 2D modes whose regime belongs to strong turbulence. In addition to shedding light on the origin of this intermittency, we derive a log-Poisson law, \${\i}t{\textbackslash}zeta\_p=p/8+1-(1/4){\textasciicircum}p/2\$ , which fits the data perfectly and highlights the important role of parallel current sheets.},

The present-day increase of computing power, which allows for the exploration of different configurations of turbulence in conducting flows, and the development of shell-to-shell transfer functions, has led to detailed studies of interactions between the velocity and the magnetic field and between scales. In particular, processes such as induction and dynamo action, the damping of velocity fluctuations by the Lorentz force, and the development of anisotropies can be characterized at different scales. In this context we consider three different configurations often studied in the literature: mechanically forced turbulence, freely decaying turbulence, and turbulence in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. Each configuration is of interest for different geophysical and astrophysical applications. Local and nonlocal transfers are discussed for each case. Whereas the transfer between scales of solely kinetic or solely magnetic energy is local, transfers between kinetic and magnetic fields are observed to be local or nonlocal depending on the configuration. Scale interactions in the cascade of magnetic helicity are also reviewed. Based on the results, the validity of several usual assumptions in hydrodynamic turbulence, such as isotropy of the small scales or universality, is discussed.},

We present a study of the spatio-temporal behavior of turbulent flows in the presence of different restitutive forces. We show how to compute and analyse the spatio-temporal spectrum from data stemming from numerical simulations and from laboratory experiments. Four cases are considered: homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, rotating turbulence, stratified turbulence, and water wave turbulence. For homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the spectrum allows identification of sweeping by the large-scale flow. For rotating and for stratified turbulence, the spectrum allows identification of the waves, precise quantification of the energy in the waves and in the turbulent eddies, and identification of physical mechanisms such as Doppler shift and wave absorption in critical layers. Finally, in water wave turbulence the spectrum shows a transition from gravity-capillary waves to bound waves as the amplitude of the forcing is increased. Graphical abstract},
