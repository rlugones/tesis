We considered cases with relatively small, intermediate and large values of a mean background magnetic field, and with null, small and high cross-helicity. 

It was observed that time decorrelations are dominated by sweeping effects for low values of the mean magnetic field and of the cross-helicity, while for large values of the mean magnetic field or of the cross-helicity, time decorrelations are controlled by Alfvénic effects even when the Alfvén time is not the fastest time, a new feature when compared with previous studies of spatio-temporal behavior of strong MHD turbulence with zero cross-helicity. This behavior could be interpreted as a transition towards a regime with weaker non-linearities as the cross-helicity is increased, as often argued on theoretical grounds and apparently indicated by our numerical simulations.

The other main result obtained from our analysis is the finding of a regime in which opposite polarizations z− and z+ fluctuations are generated, and propagate in the same direction due to wave reflections caused by inhomogeneities of the large-scale magnetic field. In this work, we were able to see this effect, previously described as an "inhomogeneous effect", here as a consequence of the separation of scales of turbulence within a periodic domain. The inhomogeneities here are the largest wave lengths.

The results analyzed in this paper show in detail that, at least in the strong turbulence regime, the wave picture is not complete enough to describe the system of incompressible MHD. We showed that physically relevant phenomena such as reflection and "anomalous propagation" of reflected fluctuations can produce observable effects in the flow energetics, and these phenomena have been recognized in a variety of configurations of the different controlling parameters of the system, with potential applications.
