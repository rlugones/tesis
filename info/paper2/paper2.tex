\begin{abstract}
  We study the spatio-temporal behavior of the Els\"asser variables
  describing magnetic and velocity field fluctuations, using direct
  numerical simulations of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
  turbulence. We consider cases with relatively small, intermediate,
  and large values of a mean background magnetic field, and with null,
  small, and high cross-helicity (correlations between the velocity
  and the magnetic field). Wavenumber-dependent time correlation
  functions are computed for the different simulations. From these
  correlation functions, the decorrelation time is computed and
  compared with different theoretical characteristic times: the local
  non-linear time, the random-sweeping time, and the Alfv\'enic
  time. It is found that decorrelation times are dominated by sweeping
  effects for low values of the mean magnetic field and for low values
  of the cross-helicity, while for large values of the background
  field or of the cross-helicity and for wave vectors sufficiently
  aligned with the guide field, decorrelation times are controlled by
  Alfv\'enic effects. Finally, we observe counter-propagation of
  Alfv\'enic fluctuations due to reflections produced by
  inhomogeneities in the total magnetic field. This effect becomes
  more prominent in flows with large cross-helicity, strongly
  modifying the propagation of waves in turbulent magnetohydrodynamic
  flows.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec_Intro}

Turbulent fluctuations are essentially broadband, both in spatial and
temporal scales, involving non-linear couplings among a wide range of
scales \cite{frisch_turbulence_1995}. In incompressible
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) \cite{pouquet_strong_1976,
  zhou_magnetohydrodynamic_2004} these couplings are based on
interactions of triads of modes \cite{zhou_non-gaussian_1993, 
  alexakis_turbulent_2007, teaca_energy_2009, aluie_2010, 
  mininni_scale_2011} which can be of different types, such as (local 
in wavenumber space) nonlinear distortions of eddies, or (non-local 
in wavenumber space) sweeping of small eddies by larger ones
\cite{kraichnan_structure_1959,
  tennekes_eulerian_1975, chen_sweeping_1989, nelkin_time_1990,
  matthaeus_eulerian_2010, servidio_time_2011,
  carbone_anisotropy_2011}. Of course, these non-linear couplings also
involve interactions with waves in the flow, which are ubiquitous in
MHD flows as well as in plasma turbulence.

The incompressible MHD equations sustain Alfv\'en waves, which in the
presence of a background magnetic field $\vec{B}_0'$ are described by
a linear dispersion relation of frequency
$\omega={\bf k} \cdot {\bf V}_\textrm{A}$ for the wavevector
${\bf k}$, with Alfv\'en velocity
${\bf V}_\textrm{A}={\bf B}_0'/\sqrt{4\pi \rho}$ and with mass density
$\rho$. It is well known that these waves, when considered in
isolation, are also exact solutions of the non-linear MHD (ideal)
equations. Simultaneous presence of counter-propagating fluctuations
however activate nonlinear interactions among modes, producing
dispersion, and in consequence the waves are no longer exact solutions
of the system \cite{dobrowolny_1980_HydromagneticTurbulence}. As the
background magnetic field controls the propagation velocity (i.e., the
Alfv\'en velocity), the non-linear interaction is influenced by the
Alfv\'en crossing time of counter-propagating wave packets. There is
therefore a competition between non-linear interactions (i.e.,
turbulence) and wave propagation \cite{dmitruk_waves_2009}.

The strength of counter-propagating fluctuations can be measured by
the cross-helicity, a quantity which is a quadratic invariant of the
ideal MHD equations (see Sec.~\ref{sec_EqNumSim} for specifics). This
quantity is also of relevance for the solar wind and for space
plasmas, as large-scale flows with cross-helicity (in the presence of
a guide field) are often found in the interplanetary medium. A
spatio-temporal analysis of field fluctuations
\cite{servidio_time_2011, clark_di_leoni_spatio-temporal_2015} can
thus be performed to quantitatively study the importance of these
different effects, and to distinguish which is the dominant timescale
among the different ones depending on the controlling parameters of
the system. This kind of analysis was performed in the past for MHD
flows without cross-helicity \cite{meyrand_weak_2015,
  lugones_2016_spatiotemporal, meyrand_direct_2016}, observing
different behaviors depending on whether the turbulence is weak or
strong. The prevailing conclusion, for strong turbulence, is that the
time decorrelation of Fourier modes in the inertial range is typically
dominated by the sweeping decorrelation due to large scale flows
\cite{servidio_time_2011, chen_sweeping_1989,
  lugones_2016_spatiotemporal}.  However, the effect of changing the
strength of counter-propagating fluctuations in the spatio-temporal
behavior of the flow, and in its decorrelation time, was not
considered before.

In the present paper we perform a spatio-temporal analysis of MHD
turbulence, controlling simultaneously and separately the intensity of
the background magnetic field and the amount of cross-helicity in the
flow, extending our previous study \cite{lugones_2016_spatiotemporal}
of incompressible MHD with a background magnetic field and no
cross-helicity. We present several numerical solutions of the
incompressible MHD equations in a turbulent steady state, and analyze
each timescale in the system using wavenumber-dependent time
correlation functions, and spatio-temporal spectra of the Els\"asser
variables. The spatio-temporal study of the Els\"asser variables
allows us to disentangle the two possible polarizations of the
Alfv\'en waves, as well as their direction of propagation, and to
quantify any imbalance between the two polarizations. We find that
decorrelation times are dominated by sweeping effects for low values
of the mean magnetic field and for low values of the cross-helicity,
while for large values of the background field or of the
cross-helicity decorrelation times are controlled by the Alfv\'enic
times. Moreover, for large values of the cross-helicity we also
observe counter-propagation of Alfv\'enic fluctuations (i.e., an
inversion in the direction of propagation of one polarization of
Alfv\'en waves), resulting from reflections in inhomogeneities of the
total magnetic field produced by the turbulence. Under some
conditions, this can result in the propagation of both polarizations
of the Alfv\'en waves in the same direction. This effect strongly
affects non-linear interactions.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec.~\ref{sec_EqNumSim}
we introduce the equations and the numerical methods employed, as well
as a description of the spatio-temporal spectrum and of the
correlation functions. Results are presented in
Sec.~\ref{sec_results}. Finally, discussions and conclusions are
presented in Sec.~\ref{sec_Conclusions}.

\section{Equations and numerical simulations}\label{sec_EqNumSim}

\subsection{The MHD equations and the Els\"asser fields}\label{sec_eq}
The incompressible MHD equations (momentum and induction equations) in
dimensionless units are
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MHD_v}
  \frac {\partial {\bf v}}{\partial t} +
  {\bf v }\cdot \nabla {\bf v} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p +
  {\bf j} \times {\bf B} + \frac{1}{R} \nabla^2{\bf v} + \vec{F}_v,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MHD_b}
  \frac{\partial {\bf b}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times ({\bf v} 
  \times {\bf B}) + \frac{1}{R_m} \nabla^2 {\bf b} + \vec{F}_b,
\end{equation}
where ${\bf v}$ is the plasma bulk velocity, ${\bf B} = {\bf b} + {\bf B}_0$ is the total magnetic field (in units
of an Alfv\'enic speed, and obtained from the total magnetic field
${\bf B}'$ in Gaussian units after dividing by $\sqrt{4\pi\rho}$,
where $\rho$ is the plasma density), and $\vec{F}_v$ and $\vec{F}_b$ are forcing terms to be discussed in more detail below. The total magnetic field has a
fluctuating part ${\bf b}$, and a mean DC field
${\bf B}_0=B_0\hat{x}$. Finally, ${\bf j} = \nabla \times {\bf b}$ is
the current density and $p$ is the pressure. The units are based on a
characteristic speed $v_0$, which for MHD is chosen to be the typical
Alfv\'en speed of the magnetic field fluctuations,
$v_0 = \sqrt{\langle b^2 \rangle /(4\pi\rho)}$, where
$\langle . \rangle$ denotes a spatial average. The dimensionless
parameters appearing in the equations are the kinetic and magnetic
Reynolds numbers, $R=v_0 L/\nu$ and $R_m = v_0 L /\mu$ respectively,
with $\nu$ the kinematic viscosity, $\mu$ the magnetic diffusivity, and
$L$ the characteristic length scale (the simulation box side length is
defined as $2\pi L$). The unit time is $t_0 = L/v_0$, which for MHD
becomes the Alfv\'en crossing time based on magnetic field
fluctuations. The Els\"asser fields are then defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MHD_zdef}
\vec{z}^\pm = \vec{v} \pm \vec{b} .
\end{equation}

In terms of the Els\"asser fields, the MHD equations can be written
\cite{servidio_time_2011} as
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \vec{z}^\pm  = \pm  \vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \nabla \vec{z}^\pm  - 
\vec{z}^\mp \cdot \nabla \vec{z}^\pm - \nabla{P} + 
\frac{1}{R} \nabla^2 \vec{z}^\pm ,
\label{eq:Elsasser}
\end{equation}
with $P=p/\rho$, and with the assumption that $R=R_m$. In the
r.h.s.~of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Elsasser}) we explicitly separated the
convective term into a linear part describing Alfv\'enic propagation
with $\vec{V}_\textrm{A} = \vec{B}_0$ the Alfv\'en velocity based on
the background magnetic field (with $\vec{B}_0$ the field in units of
velocity), and the non-linear part describing the interaction among
counter-propagating wave-like fluctuations. It is evident from these
equations that both Els\"asser fields must be present to activate the
non-linear interactions.

The ideal invariants (i.e., with zero viscosity and resistivity) of
incompressible MHD theory can be written in terms of the Els\"asser
fields. The total energy $E$ (kinetic plus magnetic) in terms of these
variables is
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{2}\int{\left(\left|\vec{v}\right|^2 +
    \left|\vec{b}\right|^2 \right)\,dV} =
    \frac{1}{4}\int{\left(\left|\vec{z}^+\right|^2 +
    \left|\vec{z}^-\right|^2 \right)\,dV},
\label{eq:ener}
\end{equation}
while the cross-helicity $H_c$ is
\begin{equation}
H_c = \int{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{b} \, dV} =
    \frac{1}{4}\int{\left(\left|\vec{z}^+\right|^2 
    - \left|\vec{z}^-\right|^2 \right)\,dV} .
\label{eq:cross}
\end{equation}
The ratio $\sigma_c = H_c/E$ measures the amount of counter-propagating
fluctuations in the system. A value $\sigma_c = \pm 1$ corresponds to
only one type of fluctuations $\vec{z}^\pm$, while $\sigma_c=0$
represents equipartition between both fields.

Following the works of Matthaeus {\it et al.}
\cite{matthaeus1994transport} and Zhou {\it et al.}
\cite{zhou1990remarks}, the ideal MHD equations can be linearized
considering the presence of an inhomogeneous background magnetic field
and/or an inhomogeneous background flow, as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MHD_zpzm}
  \partial_t \vec{z}^\pm
  + \left( L^\pm_\vec{x} + L^\pm \right) \vec{z}^\pm
  + M^\pm_{ik} \vec{z}^\mp_k
  = 0,
\end{equation}
The linear operators $L^\pm_\vec{x}$, $L^\pm$, and $M^\pm_{ik}$
involve gradients acting on both the large- and the small-scale
fields, and are given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MHD_Lx}
  L^\pm_\vec{x} = \left( \vec{U} \mp \vec{V}_\textrm{A} \right) \cdot \nabla ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MHD_L}
  L^\pm = \frac{1}{2} \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{\vec{U}}{2} \pm \vec{V}_\textrm{A} 
  \right) ,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MHD_Mik}
  M^\pm_{ik} = \nabla_k U_i \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\rho}} \nabla_k B_i'
  - \frac{1}{2} \delta_{ik} \nabla\cdot \left( \frac{\vec{U}}{2} \pm
  \vec{V}_\textrm{A} \right) ,
\end{equation}
where $\vec{U}$ is a background flow. Here, both $\vec{U}$ and
$\vec{V}_\textrm{A}$ can include large-scale inhomogeneities
(including, for $\vec{V}_\textrm{A}$, inhomogeneities associated to
density fluctuations). The mixing terms (those involving the
$M_{ik}^\pm$ operators) allow the possibility of creating counter
propagating fluctuations out of a single-sign propagating fluctuation,
by means of reflections due to inhomogeneities in any of the
background fields \cite{velli_1993_propagation}. In this sense, even
if the system starts from an initial condition with only one sign of
propagating fluctuations, the reflections by inhomogeneous background
fields will create an amount of counter propagating fluctuations which
will turn on non-linearities, producing dispersion and turbulence
\cite{matthaeus_1999_coronal, dmitruk_2001_coronal}. But this effect
can also result, in flows with both polarizations of Alfv\'enic
excitations, in the counter-propagation of one of the excitations, as
will be shown from numerical data in Sec.~\ref{sec_results}.

\subsection{Wavenumber-frequency spectrum and correlation functions}\label{sec_Wfspectrum_and_Gamma}

Using scaling arguments, different characteristic times in the system
can be estimated. The local eddy turnover time or isotropic non-linear
timescale can be defined as $\tau_{nl} \sim 1/\left[ k v(k) \right]$,
where $v(k)$ is the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations at scale
$\sim 1/k$. Considering a Kolmogorov-like scaling
$v(k) \sim v_{rms} \left(kL\right)^{-1/3}$, the nonlinear time in the
inertial range can be written as
\begin{equation}
\tau_{nl} = C_{nl} \left [
   v_{rms} L^{-1/3} \left(\sqrt{k^2_\perp +
   k^2_\parallel}\right)^{2/3}\right ]^{-1},
\label{eq:taunl}
\end{equation}
where $C_{nl}$ is a dimensionless constant of order one, and
$k_\parallel$ and $k_\perp$ denote the wavenumbers parallel and
perpendicular to the background magnetic field. Here,
$v_{rms} = \left\langle |{\bf v}|^2 \right\rangle ^{1/2}$ is a global
quantity, dominated by contributions from the large scales
\cite{zhou_magnetohydrodynamic_2004, matthaeus_anisotropic_2009}.

Another time decorrelation effect is governed by the sweeping
characteristic time, which at the scale $\sim 1/k$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\tau_{sw} = C_{sw} \left( v_{rms}\sqrt{k^2_\perp + k^2_\parallel}
    \right)^{-1} .
\label{eq:tausw}
\end{equation}
This time corresponds to the advection of small-scale structures by
the large-scale flow. Finally, a characteristic Alfv\'en time can be
defined as
\begin{equation}
\tau_A= C_A \left( v_A k_\parallel \right)^{-1} .
\label{eq:taua}
\end{equation}
In the last two expressions, $C_{sw}$ and $C_A$ also are dimensionless
constants of order unity.

These are not all the times scales that could be present in MHD turbulence, 
but the ones most relevant for the discussions in the following sections. 
As an example, another time scale worth mentioning is the decorrelation 
time of triple moments when there is no equipartition between magnetic 
and kinetic energies, e.g., in the dynamo context 
\cite{baerenzung_2008_spectral}.

To disentangle these time scales in the flow, and to identify which is 
the most relevant time scale at a given spatial scale, two tools can be 
used: the statistical properties of the correlation function in space
and time, and the wavenumber-frequency spectrum. We start by
introducing the former. The statistics of the Els\"asser fields can be
characterized by the spatio-temporal two-point autocorrelation
function \cite{servidio_time_2011},
 \begin{equation}
 R^\pm({\bf r},\tau) = \left\langle {\bf z}^\pm( {\bf x},t) \cdot
   {\bf z} ^\pm( {\bf x} + {\bf r},t+\tau) \right\rangle \Big/ 
   \left\langle \left|{{\bf z}^\pm}\right|^2 \right\rangle.
 \label{eq:Rzij}
 \end{equation}
 The Fourier transform in $\vec{r}$ leads to a time-lagged spectral
 density which can be further factorized as
 $S({\bf k},\tau) = S({\bf k})\Gamma({\bf k},\tau)$. The function
 $\Gamma({\bf k},\tau)$ is the scale-dependent correlation function
 \cite{heisenberg_zur_1948,
   comte-bellot_simple_1971,orszag_numerical_1972} which describes the
 time decorrelation of each spatial mode ${\bf k}$, that is, the loss
 of memory of fluctuations with characteristics lengths of order
 $k_x^{-1}$, $k_y^{-1}$, and $k_z^{-1}$.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{fig1_E.eps}
\caption{Reduced perpendicular energy spectra $E(k_\perp)$ for
  simulations with $B_0=0$, $0.25$, $1$, $2$, $4$, and $8$. All curves
  correspond to the case $\sigma_c = 0.3$, but the cases with $\sigma_c = 0$ and
  $0.9$ show the same behavior. Kolmogorov scaling,
  $\sim k_\perp^{-5/3}$, is shown as reference.}
\label{fig1:E}
\end{figure}

When there is a preferential direction in the flow (as in the present
case of MHD turbulence with a guide magnetic field), it is useful to
assume axial symmetry in Fourier space and to write
$\Gamma({\bf k},\tau) = \Gamma(k_\perp,k_\parallel,\tau)$. As this
function is three dimensional, it is also useful to study
$\Gamma(k_\perp,k_\parallel,\tau)$ with one of the arguments fixed;
for instance, fixing a value of $k_\perp$ and analyzing
$\Gamma(k_\perp,k_\parallel,\tau)$ as a function of $k_\parallel$ and
$\tau$ gives us information on fluctuations that vary only in the
parallel direction, and allow us to distinguish between decorrelation
arising from Alfv\'enic non-linear interactions or sweeping.

The Fourier transform in the time lag of the scale-dependent
correlation function results in the wavenumber-frequency spectrum
$E^\pm(\vec{k},\omega)$ \cite{clark_di_leoni_quantification_2014,
  clark_di_leoni_spatio-temporal_2015}, for each of the Els\"asser
fields. These spectra allow identification of modes satisfying a
generalized dispersion relation of the system, and provide a direct
measurement of how much energy is in those modes, and of how much
energy is in other modes. For the two separate Els\"asser fields, from
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:ener}) and (\ref{eq:cross}) it is easy to see that
\begin{equation}
  E = E^+ + E^- , \,\,\,\, H_c = E^+ - E^- ,
\end{equation}
where $E^\pm = \int |\vec{z}^\pm|^2/4 \, dV$. Thus, for the
wavenumber-frequency spectra of the Els\"asser fields, the two
following relations hold
\begin{eqnarray}
  E^+(\vec{k},\omega) &=& [E(\vec{k},\omega) + H_c(\vec{k},\omega)]/2, \\
  E^-(\vec{k},\omega) &=& [E(\vec{k},\omega) - H_c(\vec{k},\omega)]/2.
\end{eqnarray}
Therefore, computation of the wavenumber-frequency spectra of the
energy and of the cross-helicity allows unique determination of the
wavenumber-frequency spectra of the Els\"asser fields, and vice-versa.

    logarithmic scale). The lines indicate the modes for which the
    sweeping time (red dashed line) or the local non-linear time
    (solid blue line) become equal to the Alfv\'en time. For large
    $B_0$ the flow becomes more anisotropic, and isocontours change
    shape as they cross these lines. Note also the increase in the
    energy in modes that have the Alfv\'en time as the fastest time
    (i.e., of modes below the solid blue curve) as $B_0$ increases.}
  \label{fig2:isocontourns}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Numerical simulations}\label{sec_NumSim}

To solve numerically the incompressible MHD equations we employ a
standard pseudo-spectral code \cite{gomez_parallel_2005,
  gomez_mhd_2005, hybrid2011}. We consider a spatial resolution of 
$N^3 = 512^3$ grid points, with a second-order Runge-Kutta time 
integration scheme. Spatial resolution is moderate as we need to store 
a large amount of data in space and time to compute the correlation 
functions and spectra defined in Sec.~\ref{sec_Wfspectrum_and_Gamma}. 
Values considered for the intensity of the external magnetic field are 
$B_0 = 0, 0.25$, $1$, $2$, $4$ and $8$ (in units of the initial 
r.m.s.~magnetic fluctuations value). We assume periodic boundary 
conditions in a cube of side $2\pi L$ (with $L$ the initial correlation 
length of the fluctuations, defined as the unit length). Aliasing is 
removed by the two-thirds rule truncation method.

\begin{figure*}
  \centering 
  \subfigure[$B_0 = 0$, $\vec{z}^-$, $\sigma_c = 0.3$]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{{fig3_B0.0_y_Hc0.3_zm_kperp0}.eps}}

  \caption{Normalized wave vector and frequency spectra
    $E^\pm({\bf k}, \omega)/E^+({\bf k})$ of $\vec{z}^-$ (left) and
    $\vec{z}^+$ (right), for the isotropic simulations ($B_0=0$) with
    $\sigma_c = 0.3$ [top, panels (a) and (b)] and $\sigma_c = 0.9$ [bottom,
    panels (c) and (d)], as a function of $k_\parallel$ and for fixed
    $k_\perp=0$. Lighter regions indicate larger energy density. The
    spectra correspond to the power in the time and space Fourier
    transform of the fields, such that accumulation of energy in modes
    near the dispersion relation (or in all modes below the sweeping
    curve) points to a dominance of a physical effect (i.e., of its
    associated frequency) in the dynamics of a given scale
    $\sim 1/k_\parallel$. As a reference, the sweeping time relation
    giving by Eq.~(\ref{eq:tausw}) is indicated by solid (green)
    lines. A broad excitation of modes is observed for all modes with
    $\omega \leq 1/\tau_{sw}$ (sweeping) in panels (a) and (b), and
    for $\omega \approx 0$ in panels (c) and (d).}
  \label{fig3:B0_spectrum_Hc}
\end{figure*}

The initial condition in all simulations consists of nonzero
amplitudes for the ${\bf v}({\bf k})$ and ${\bf b}({\bf k})$ fields,
equipartitioned in all the wavenumbers within shells
$1.1 \leq k \leq 4$ (in units of $2\pi L/\lambda$, with $\lambda$ the
wavelength). Random phases are chosen for all Fourier modes in both
fields. To keep the system in a turbulent steady state we apply a
driving consisting of forcing terms $\vec{F}_b$ and $\vec{F}_v$ 
for $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{v}$ respectively, in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:MHD_v}) 
and (\ref{eq:MHD_b}). $\vec{F}_b$ and $\vec{F}_v$ are band limited to 
a fixed set of Fourier modes in the band $0.9\leq k \leq 1.8$. The driving has a
random and a time-coherent component, and the correlation time of the
forcing is $\tau_f \approx 1$ (of the order of the unit time
$t_0$), which is larger than all the characteristic times 
defined in the previous section. To change the level of cross-helicity in the flow,
correlations were introduced between the mechanical and electromotive
drivings, resulting at late times (depending on the level of
cross-correlation between the drivers) in a normalized cross-helicity of 
$\sigma_c=0$, $0.3$, or $0.9$ (these values correspond to the time average 
in the turbulent steady state; in practice, in each simulation the
instantaneous cross-helicity fluctuates in time around the reported
mean values).

Note the different values of $B_0$ and of $\sigma_c$ explored result in a
total of 18 simulations. All simulations were continued until the
system reached a turbulent steady state, and then continued further to
perform the spatio-temporal analysis on the evolution of the
Els\"asser fields presented in the next section. We will first
characterize the spatial behavior of the flows (specially considering
the degree of anisotropy as the intensity of the background flow is
increased), to then study the behavior of the Els\"asser fluctuations
using the spatio-temporal information.

\subsection{Wavenumber spectra}

After the system reached the turbulent steady state, we analyzed the
results during $10$ large-scale unit times, after verifying that this
time span was enough to ensure convergence of spatio-temporal spectra
and correlation functions.

We start discussing the spatial spectral, to characterize the
turbulence and to quantify its anisotropy as the intensity of the
guide field is varied, for different values of the cross-helicity. The
reduced perpendicular energy spectra $E(k_\perp)$ are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig1:E} for the simulations with $B_0=0$, $0.25$, 1, 2, 4,
and 8 with normalized cross-helicity $\sigma_c=0.3$. The simulations 
with $\sigma_c=0$ and $\sigma_c=0.9$ display a similar behavior. A 
Kolmogorov power law is also indicated in the figure as reference. 
As can be seen, despite the moderate spatial resolution of the runs, 
the observed spatial spectra are compatible with Kolmogorov scaling 
$\sim k_\perp^{-5/3}$, and the simulations are well resolved 
displaying a dissipative range for large wavenumbers (for example, the
Kolmogorov dissipation wavenumbers $k_\nu$ are $k_\nu \approx 91$, $152$, 
and $122$ for the simulations with $B_0 = 1$ and $\sigma_c = 0$, $0.3$, 
and $0.9$ respectively).

A more detailed illustration the spectral behavior (and of the anisotropy ç
of the flows) can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig2:isocontourns}. There, we show 
isocontours of the axisymmetric energy spectrum $e(k_\perp, k_\parallel)$ 
(i.e., the energy density as a function of perpendicular and parallel
wavenumbers) for $B_0=0$, 1, 4, and 8, and in all cases for flows with
$\sigma_c = 0.3$. As a reference we also indicate the curves (in Fourier
space) where the Alfv\'en time is equal to either the sweeping time,
or the non-linear time. In other words, these curves separate regions
in which (from theoretical arguments) the fastest time scale can be
expected to be either $\tau_A$ (above the dashed red curve) or
$\tau_{nl}$ (below the solid blue curve). The sweeping time can be
relevant for all modes below the dashed red curve.

\end{figure}

Note that for $B_0 \neq 0$ the energy is not distributed isotropically
in the axisymmetric spectra in Fig.~\ref{fig2:isocontourns}. Energy
tends to accumulate in modes with small $k_\parallel$ as $B_0$ is
increased, and for $B_0=4$ and 8, a substantial fraction of the energy
accumulates in the vicinity of the curves satisfying
$\tau_A \approx \tau_{sw}$ and $\tau_A \approx \tau_{nl}$.

\subsection{Wavenumber-frequency spectra}\label{sec:wk}

The main results of the present study are summarized in
Figs.~\ref{fig3:B0_spectrum_Hc} to \ref{fig3:B8_spectrum_Hc}, which
quantify the spatio-temporal behavior of the Els\"asser fields
separately. These figures show the normalized wavevector and frequency
spectra of the $\vec{z}^+$ and $\vec{z}^-$ variables, for simulations
with different values of the background mean field $B_0$ and
normalized cross-helicity $\sigma_c$. As the spectra are multidimensional, in all
cases we show slices of the spectrum for $k_\perp=0$ and as a function
of $k_\parallel$ and $\omega$.

Figure \ref{fig3:B0_spectrum_Hc} shows these spatio-temporal spectra
for simulations with $B_0=0$. In this case, the dispersion relation
for Alfv\'enic fluctuations becomes $\omega=0$, and Alfv\'en waves are
indistinguishable (in this spectrum) from slow modes such as turbulent
eddies. The sweeping relation, for eddies with velocity $v_{rms}$,
becomes $\omega=\pm v_{rms} k$, and in practice, as all
turbulent eddies with this velocity (or a smaller velocity) can randomly 
sweep small-scale structures in the flow, the relation for random
sweeping becomes $|\omega| \leq v_{rms} k$. Both relations
are indicated respectively by dashed and solid lines in
Fig.~\ref{fig3:B0_spectrum_Hc}.

Accumulation of energy in the spectra in
Fig.~\ref{fig3:B0_spectrum_Hc} can be seen for all modes in the region
enclosed by the sweeping relation, evidencing the presence of
broadband (strong) turbulence rather than of wave turbulence or linear
wave propagation. Moreover, for large values of the normalized cross-helicity
($\sigma_c = 0.9$), energy accumulates instead in modes with
$\omega\approx 0$, and more energy can be observed in $\vec{z}^+$
modes when compared to the $\vec{z}^-$ modes. From these 
spectra we can conclude that for $B_0=0$ and $\sigma_c=0$ the dominant
timescale is that of the sweeping, while for large values of $\sigma_c$
either the non-linear timescale or the Alfv\'en time become dominant.

Figure \ref{fig3:B025_spectrum_Hc} shows the spatio-temporal spectra
for simulations with $B_0=0.25$. The case with $\sigma_c=0$ shows again a
broad range of fluctuations in the range of frequencies enclosed by
the sweeping relation. As the value of $\sigma_c$ is increased the
$\vec{z}^+$ fluctuations become dominant, a situation which is more
evident in the case with $\sigma_c=0.9$. Also, as $\sigma_c$ is increased,
energy in $\vec{z}^+$ fluctuations leaves the funnel defined by the
sweeping relation, and concentrates in the vicinity of the dispersion
relation of Alfv\'en waves
$\omega^+ = +\vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \vec{k}$ (see the case with
$\sigma_c=0.9$ in Fig.~\ref{fig3:B025_spectrum_Hc}). Note that the choice of signs
for waves described by $\vec{z}^\pm={\vec z}_0^\pm e^{i(\vec{k} \cdot \vec{x}+\omega^\pm t)}$
follows from the fact that the Fourier
transforms used in space and in time follow the same sign convention,
and where ${\vec z}_0^\pm$ are the amplitudes of the waves. 
This way, the sign
of $\omega^+$ implies $\vec{z}^+$ fluctuations propagate anti-parallel
to the guide field, as expected. However, in an apparent
contradiction, the waves with the opposite polarization, i.e., the
$\vec{z}^-$ fluctuations, also populate (albeit with smaller
amplitude) the same upper branch of the Alfv\'enic wave dispersion
relation. As the $\vec{z}^-$ fluctuations satisfy another dispersion
relation ($\omega^- = -\vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \vec{k}$), in the
linear regime these fluctuations should populate instead the lower
branch of the dispersion relation shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig3:B025_spectrum_Hc}. This behavior indicates that
$\vec{z}^-$ fluctuations also propagate in real space in the direction
anti-parallel to the guide field (i.e., with negative velocity),
instead of parallel to this field (i.e., with positive velocity) as
would be expected. Such a behaviour was predicted by Hollweg 
\cite{hollweg_1990_wkb} for the solar wind and caused by, e.g., 
reflections of waves in density fluctuations in the interplanetary medium, 
using a WKB expansion. In our case, the flow is incompressible and density 
is uniform in space and constant in time.

\end{figure}

As $B_0$ is increased, this effect becomes more evident. In
Fig.~\ref{fig3:B1_spectrum_Hc} we show the spatio-temporal spectra for
simulations with $B_0=1$. Now energy tends to concentrate near the
dispersion relation of the Alfv\'en waves for all values of $\sigma_c$,
i.e., as we increase the value of $B_0$ the relevance of random
sweeping decreases and Alfv\'en waves become more important. For
$\sigma_c=0$ we observe waves propagating in both directions: $\vec{z}^+$
fluctuations propagate anti-parallel to the guide field, and
$\vec{z}^-$ fluctuations propagate parallel to this field. Also, for
values of $k_\parallel$ larger than $\approx 20$, the dispersion in
the excitation of modes increases and energy starts to populate the
funnel in spectral space associated with sweeping, indicating random
sweeping plays a role at sufficiently small vertical scales. Instead, for
$\sigma_c =0.3$ and $0.9$ energy accumulates only near the wave dispersion
relation, and we recover counter-propagation of one of the wave
motions: both $\vec{z}^+$ and $\vec{z}^-$ fields propagate in the same
direction, anti-parallel to the guide field. Increasing $B_0$ further
reduces this effect (see the cases with $B_0=8$ in
Fig.~\ref{fig3:B8_spectrum_Hc}), resulting in the expected propagation
for each excitation, or in very little or no propagation of
$\vec{z}^-$ when $\sigma_c$ is sufficiently small.

What is the origin of the observed $\vec{z}^-$ fluctuations
propagating in the same direction as the $\vec{z}^+$ fluctuations?
Based on the results of Hollweg \cite{hollweg_1990_wkb}, and on 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:MHD_zpzm}), they must be caused by reflections in
large scale inhomogeneities of the mean magnetic field (note there is
no mean background flow in our simulations, nor density fluctuations). 
Although our background guide field $B_0$ is uniform (i.e., constant 
in space as well as in time), the total mean field a fluctuation sees 
includes a slowly varying component (e.g., from magnetic field 
fluctuations at large scales, such as those in $k=1$ modes, which 
evolve on a slower time scale than fast waves and small-scale fluctuations). 
As a result, the flow has an effective Alfv\'en velocity that depends on 
the spatial coordinates. We can then write for either type of Els\"asser
fluctuations the ideal linearized Eq.~(\ref{eq:MHD_zpzm}) for constant
density and for $\vec{U}=0$ (no mean background flow) as
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \vec{z}^\pm = \pm \vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \nabla \vec{z}^\pm 
    \mp \vec{z}^\mp \cdot \frac{\nabla \vec{B}'}{\sqrt{4\pi \rho}} ,
\end{equation}
where $\vec{V}_\textrm{A}$ can now include large-scale fluctuations of
the magnetic field, and $\vec{B}'$ as before is the total magnetic
field in Gaussian units. If the normalized cross-helicity $\sigma_c$ is close to 1,
that is, if $|\vec{z}^+| \gg |\vec{z}^-|$, we have for $\vec{z}^+$
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \vec{z}^+  \approx \vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \nabla \vec{z}^+ ,
\end{equation}
and using
$\vec{z}^\pm = \vec{z}_0^\pm e^{i(\vec{k}\cdot \vec{x}+\omega^\pm t)}$
we recover the usual dispersion relation for waves propagating
anti-parallel to the mean field
$\omega^+ = +\vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \vec{k}$ (where now
$\vec{V}_\textrm{A}$ can fluctuate slowly in space and time). However,
for $\vec{z}^-$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \vec{z}^- \approx - \vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \nabla \vec{z}^- + \vec{z}^+ 
    \cdot \frac{\nabla \vec{B}'}{\sqrt{4\pi \rho}} .
\label{eq:zmlinear}
\end{equation}
This equation indicates that the propagation of $\vec{z}^-$
perturbations (which are smaller in amplitude than $\vec{z}^+$) can be
strongly affected by the $\vec{z}^+$ field and by spatial variations
of the large-scale magnetic field.

From Eq.~(\ref{eq:zmlinear}) we can also extract some phenomenological
conditions for the behavior seen in Figs.~\ref{fig3:B0_spectrum_Hc} to
\ref{fig3:B8_spectrum_Hc} (and in particular, for the
counter-propagation of waves) to take place. Using again
$\vec{z}^\pm = \vec{z}_0^\pm e^{i(\vec{k}\cdot \vec{x}+\omega^\pm
  t)}$, and assuming $\vec{B}' = \vec{B}_0' + \vec{b}_0'$ where
$\vec{b}_0' = \vec{\tilde{b}}_0'e^{i\vec{K} \cdot \vec{x}}$ is the
slowly varying large-scale magnetic field with wavenumber $K \ll k$,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:zmlinear}) reduces to
\begin{equation}
\left( \omega^- +\vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \vec{k} \right) 
    \vec{z}_0^- e^{i \omega^- t} = 
    \frac{\left(\vec{K} \cdot \vec{z}_0^+\right) \vec{b}_0'}{\sqrt{4\pi \rho}} 
    e^{i \omega^+ t} .
\end{equation}
Taking the dot product with $\vec{z}_0^-$, defining Els\"asser energy
densities $e^\pm = |\vec{z}_0^\pm|^2/4$, and defining the fluctuations
in the Alfv\'en velocity (associated to the large-scale magnetic field
fluctuations) as ${\bf v}_\textrm{A} = \vec{b}_0'/\sqrt{4\pi \rho}$,
we finally get
\begin{equation}
\left( \omega^- + \vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \vec{k} \right)
    e^{i \omega^- t} = 
    \frac{\left(\vec{K} \cdot \vec{z}_0^+\right)
    \left(\vec{v}_\textrm{A} \cdot \vec{z}_0^-\right)}
    {4e^-} 
    e^{i \omega^+ t} .
\end{equation}
This equation admits solutions
\begin{eqnarray}
    \omega^- &=& \omega^+ =
    + \vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \vec{k}, 
    \label{eq:cond1} \\
    2 \vec{V}_\textrm{A} \cdot \vec{k} &=& 
    \left(\vec{K} \cdot \vec{z}_0^+\right)
    \left(\vec{v}_\textrm{A} \cdot \vec{z}_0^-\right) /
    (4e^-), \label{eq:cond2}
\end{eqnarray}
which correspond to both waves traveling in the same direction as long
as the second condition, given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:cond2}), can be
fulfilled. From dimensional analysis, this condition requires that
\begin{equation}
    2 \frac{V_\textrm{A}}{v_\textrm{A}} \frac{k}{K}
    \sim \sqrt{\frac{e^+}{e^-}},
\end{equation}
which (as $V_\textrm{A}\gtrsim v_\textrm{A}$ and $k\gg K$) cannot be
satisfied when $\sigma_c \approx 0$ (as observed in
Figs.~\ref{fig3:B0_spectrum_Hc} to \ref{fig3:B8_spectrum_Hc}), or when
the guide field becomes too strong for a fixed value of $\sigma_c$ (as also
observed in the spatio-temporal spectra). Thus, this last qualitative
argument indicates (in agreement with the simulations) that
$\vec{z}^-$ fluctuations can propagate with the same phase speed and
direction as the $\vec{z}^+$ fluctuations as long as $\sigma_c \neq 0$ and
$B_0$ is not too strong for a fixed value of the normalized cross-helicity.

In other words, if $|\vec{z}^+|$ at large scales is comparable to
$|\vec{V}_\textrm{A}|$ and $\sigma_c \approx 1$, we can see $\vec{z}^-$
fluctuations propagate in the same direction as $\vec{z}^+$
fluctuations as the result of reflections in inhomogeneities of the
large-scale magnetic field. A similar behavior can result, for example, from mass
density fluctuations when the flow is compressible, as is the case in
some regions of the solar wind and the interplanetary medium \cite{zhou_1989_nonWKBevolution}, and this
argument does not preclude other effects such as strong non-linear
interactions from resulting in reflection and counter-propagation of
excitations. Moreover, when the intensity of the background magnetic
field $\vec{B}_0$ is further increased, the arguments used above are
not valid anymore and the relevance of the reflections reduces. This
is compatible with the behavior seen in Fig.~\ref{fig3:B8_spectrum_Hc}
for the simulations with $B_0=8$, which show similar amounts of power
in both type of fluctuations when $\sigma_c=0$, less power in $\vec{z}^-$
fluctuations when $\sigma_c=0.3$ (and propagating opposite to the
$\vec{z}^+$ field), and no appreciable power for $\vec{z}^-$
fluctuations when compared to $\vec{z}^+$ in the case with $\sigma_c=0.9$.

\subsection{Decorrelation times}

From the discussions in Sec.~\ref{sec_Wfspectrum_and_Gamma}, another
way to identify dominant time scales for individual modes is to study
the decorrelation time $\tau_D$, i.e., the time it takes for each
Fourier mode with wave vector ${\bf k}$ to be decorrelated from its
previous history either by non-linear eddy interactions (if
$\tau_D \sim \tau_{nl}$), by the cross-over of waves (if
$\tau_D \sim \tau_A$), or by the sweeping by the large-scale flow
(when $\tau_D \sim \tau_{sw}$). Again, as $\tau_D$ depends on the wave
vector ${\bf k}$, in the following we show it for fixed values of
$k_\parallel$ or $k_\perp$, and as a function of the remaining
wavenumber. In all cases, the decorrelation time $\tau_D$ is obtained
from the numerical data by computing the correlation function
$\Gamma(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel},\tau)$, and looking at the value of
the time lag $\tau$ for which the correlation function decays to $1/e$
from its value for $\tau=0$, that is, the characteristic time for the
decay of the correlation function \cite{lugones_2016_spatiotemporal}.

Figure \ref{fig5:z+_vs_z-} shows the different decorrelation times for
a fixed value of $k_{\parallel}=10$ and as a function of $k_{\perp}$,
for the simulation with $B_0=1$ and $\sigma_c=0.3$. The theoretical
predictions for the different decorrelation times are also indicated
as a reference. Since the Alfv\'enic time is independent of
$k_{\perp}$ it shows as a constant vale in this figure. The
decorrelation time $\tau_D$ obtained from the numerical data is very
close to the Alfv\'enic time for small values of $k_{\perp}$ (up to
$k_\perp \approx 10$), but it deviates and becomes closer to the
sweeping time for large values of $k_{\perp}$ (i.e, for small
perpendicular lengthscales). This is more clear for $\vec{z}^-$
fluctuations than for $\vec{z}^+$ fluctuations, for which the
decorrelation time $\tau_D$ for $k_\perp > 10$ is in between the
scaling of $\tau_{sw}$ and of $\tau_{nl}$.

Figure \ref{fig5:tD_vs_B0} shows the decorrelation times $\tau_D$ for
the $\vec{z}^+$ field for cases with $\sigma_c = 0.3$, with a guide field
of $B_0=0.25$, $1$, $4$, and $8$, and for fixed $k_\parallel = 15$ as
a function of $k_\perp$. Again, for low values of $B_0$, $\tau_D$ is
mostly dominated for the sweeping, either for all values of $k_\perp$
(for $B_0=0.25$) or down to $k_\perp \approx 20$ (for
$B_0=1$). However, for larger values of $B_0$ (or for small values of
$k_\perp$ when $B_0=1$) Alfv\'enic effects become dominant, with
$\tau_D$ taking values close to $\tau_{A}$. Overall, the fastest time
scale at any given $k_\perp$ seems to be the dominant one. These
results are consistent with the previous ones we obtained
\cite{lugones_2016_spatiotemporal} for the case of strong
incompressible MHD turbulence with no cross-helicity, although the
presence of some cross-helicity in the flow seems to favor a
transition towards a flow more dominated by Alfv\'en waves as also
seen in the spatio-temporal spectra in Sec.~\ref{sec:wk}. This can be 
also associated with the fact that under certain conditions the nonlinear
time of the dominant Els\"asser fluctuations becomes too long, and the 
decorrelation time scale is then determined by the so-called 
``minority species'' as reported before in closure calculations by 
Grappin \textit{et al.} \cite{grappin_1983_dependence}.

This behavior can also be seen when $k_\perp$ is fixed, and $\tau_D$
is studied as a function of $k_\parallel$ (see
Fig.~\ref{fig5:tD_vs_B0_2}). For simulations with $\sigma_c=0.3$ and with
increasing $B_0$, we see that $\tau_D$ varies with $k_\parallel$ as
$\tau_{sw}$ when $B_0$ is small or moderate and when $k_\parallel$ is
small, and varies as $\tau_A$ when $B_0$ or $k_\parallel$ are
sufficiently large. In other words, modes with wave vectors
sufficiently aligned with the guide field are dominated by the
Alfv\'en time. And again, the fastest time scale in this figure is the
one that dominates the dynamics.

However, and as mentioned before, this picture changes when $\sigma_c$ is
sufficiently large. This can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig5:tD_vs_Hc},
where the decorrelation time $\tau_D$ is plotted for the simulations
with $B_0=1$, for fixed $k_\perp=40$, and as a functions of
$k_\parallel$ for $\sigma_c = 0$, $0.3$ and $0.9$. While for small values
of $\sigma_c$ we observe the same behavior as before, for large values of
$\sigma_c$ the Alfv\'en time becomes dominant, even when it is slower than
all the other time scales, as in the case of the simulation with
$\sigma_c=0.9$ and small values of $k_\parallel$.

Thus, while for small values of $\sigma_c$ the analysis of the
decorrelation time confirms the tendency observed in our previous
study \cite{lugones_2016_spatiotemporal} that the sweeping time
dominates the decorrelations except for the cases with medium and
large values of $B_0$ where the Alfv\'enic time is dominant for small
values of $k_{\perp}$ or large values of $k_{\parallel}$ (see also
studies of MHD turbulence in the weak regime, or of the transition
from weak to strong MHD turbulence in Refs.~\cite{meyrand_weak_2015,
  lugones_2016_spatiotemporal, meyrand_direct_2016}), increasing the
cross-helicity content of the flow has interesting consequences. The
appearance of the Alfv\'enic time as dominant becomes more clear for
large values of $\sigma_c$, even when it is not the fastest time scale, and
consistent with a linear (or weakly non-linear) picture in which most
of the fluctuations have a single direction of propagation. However,
as evidenced in the spatio-temporal analysis of the energy spectrum of
each Els\"asser field as a function of $\vec{k}$ and $\omega$,
inhomengeneities of the large scale magnetic field can induce
reflections, and turn on non-linear interactions dominated by the
Alfv\'en cross-over time between waves for modes with wave vectors
sufficiently aligned with the guide field, or by the sweeping or
non-linear time for other modes.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec_Conclusions}

We analyzed the spatio-temporal behavior of MHD fluctuations
considering their polarizations in terms of the Els\"asser variables,
using direct numerical simulations of three-dimensional incompressible
MHD turbulence. We considered cases with relatively small,
intermediate, and large values of a mean background magnetic field,
and with null, small, and high cross-helicity. The correlation
function as a function of the wavenumber (decomposed in perpendicular
and parallel directions to the mean magnetic field) and of the time
lag was directly computed for all the different simulations
considered, as well as the spatio-temporal spectra. From the
correlation functions, we computed the decorrelation time for each
Fourier mode, and we compared it with different theoretical
predictions for relevant time scales in the system: the local
non-linear time, the random sweeping time and the Alfv\'enic time. It
was observed that time decorrelations are dominated by sweeping
effects for low values of the mean magnetic field and of the
cross-helicity, while for large values of the mean magnetic field or
of the cross-helicity, time decorrelations are controlled by
Alfv\'enic effects even when the Alfv\'en time is not the fastest
time, a new feature when compared with previous studies of
spatio-temporal behavior of strong MHD turbulence with zero
cross-helicity. In principle, this behavior could be interpreted as a
transition towards a regime with weaker non-linearities as the
cross-helicity is increased, as often argued on theoretical grounds 
and apparently indicated by our numerical simulations.

However, it should be noted that the spatio-temporal spectra indicate
that even in this regime non-linear interactions are relevant: The
other main result obtained from our analysis is the finding of a
regime in which opposite polarizations $\vec{z}^-$ and $\vec{z}^+$
fluctuations are generated, and propagate in the same direction due to
wave reflections caused by inhomogeneities of the large-scale magnetic
field. This is more evident in the spatio-temporal spectra of the
Els\"asser fields for intermediate values of the background magnetic
field (that is, when the uniform and constant component of the
large-scale magnetic field is not too strong). A phenomenological
analysis based on previous ideas in Zhou and Matthaeus
\cite{zhou1990remarks} confirms the conclusions of Hollweg 
\cite{hollweg_1990_wkb}, that indicates that Alfv\'enic fluctuations with
opposite polarizations can indeed propagate in the same direction and
even with the same speed. If the background magnetic field becomes too
strong (or if the cross-helicity is close to zero), this effect is no
longer observed. Thus, the spatio-temporal analysis of the turbulent
flows provides direct evidence of a phenomena that was predicted before 
using WKB theory, and which can play a relevant role modifying wave 
propagation and nonlinear interactions in the interplanetary medium.

The results analyzed in this paper show in detail that, at least in
the strong turbulence regime, the wave picture is not complete enough
to describe the system of incompressible MHD. A broad band of
fluctuations appear in this system coming from local and non-local
(sweeping) effects, which bring in dispersion and non-linear
effects. It is important to recall, of course, that much of the
present study has concentrated on the study of the Eulerian decorrelation 
time, decomposed into a scale-dependent decorrelation time of individual 
Fourier modes. This decorrelation is generally interpreted as a 
competition between sweeping decorrelation by large scale fluctuations, 
and decorrelation originating from wave propagation. However, neither 
of these effects are in principle responsible for the spectral transfer
that gives rise to the turbulence cascade. In fact, the main effect of 
Alfv\'en propagation, from the perspective of the strong turbulent 
energy cascade,  is not to cause spectral transfer but to suppress it 
\cite{shebalin_1983_anisotropy}.  Understanding the cascade itself
requires examination of the strength of the nonlinearities. In this case, 
the appropriate characteristic time becomes the nonlinear time, whose 
isolation requires analysis of timescales in the Lagrangian frame
\cite{kraichnan_1964_kolmogorov} (note that only in a few particular cases 
in our analisys, the nonlinear time was positively identified as a 
candidate for the decorrelation time). Nevertheless, we have shown that 
physically relevant phenomena such as reflection and ``anomalous
propagation'' of reflected fluctuations can produce observable
effects in the flow energetics, and these phenomena have been recognized
in a variety of configurations of the different controlling parameters 
of the system, with potential applications.

For example, interesting effects associated with reflection add to the
complexity of the dynamics, even in the simplest case of
incompressible MHD considered here. This has important implications
for applications such as coronal heating, solar wind acceleration, and
particle energization in the interplanetary space
\cite{velli_1993_propagation, matthaeus_1999_coronal}. As a further example,
fluctuations observed in the solar wind, which tend to have the
magnetic and the velocity field aligned or anti-aligned (i.e., with
different Alfv\'enic polarizations), cannot always be trivially
interpreted as travelling ``downstream'' or ``upstream'' the mean
magnetic field. Extensions of this study to compressible MHD
\cite{andres_2017_interplay}, considering the dependence with the
cross-helicity in the flow and its interplay with compressible
effects, as well as a study considering other helicities such as 
the kinetic helicity $H_v$ or the magnetic helicity $H_b$ and the 
hybrid helicity for Hall-MHD, would be an
interesting follow up of the present study, and a
first step towards a deeper understanding of the role of non-linear
effects in the propagation of waves in plasma turbulence.
