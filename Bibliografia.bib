	abstract = {Incompressible turbulent flows are investigated in the framework of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. All the field quantities vary with only two spatial dimensions. Equilibrium canonical distributions are determined in a phase space whose co-ordinates are the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier coefficients for the field variables. In the geometry considered, the magnetic field and fluid velocity have variable
              x
              and
              y
              components, and all field quantities are independent of
              z.
              Three constants of the motion are found (one of them new) which survive the truncation in Fourier space and permit the construction of canonical distributions with three independent temperatures. Spectral densities are calculated. One of the more novel physical effects is the appearance of macroscopic structures involving long wavelength, self-generated, magnetic fields (‘magnetic islands’) for a wide range of initial parameters. Current filaments show a tendency toward consolidation in much the same way that vorticity filaments do in the guiding-centre plasma case. In the presence of finite dissipation, energy cascades to higher wavenumbers can be accompanied by vector potential cascades to lower wavenumbers, in much the same way as, in the fluid dynamic (Navier-Stokes) case, energy cascades to lower wavenumbers accompany enstrophy cascades to higher wavenumbers. It is suggested that the techniques may be relevant to theories of the magnetic dynamo problem and to the generation of megagauss magnetic fields when pellets are irradiated by lasers.},

	abstract = {The equations of motion for turbulent two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flows are solved in the presence of finite viscosity and resistivity, for the case in which external forces (mechanical and/or magnetic) act on the fluid. The goal is to verify the existence of a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo effect which is represented mathematically by a substantial back-transfer of mean square vector potential to the longest allowed Fourier wavelengths. External forces consisting of a random part plus a fraction of the value at the previous time step are employed, after the manner of Lilly for the Navier–Stokes case. The regime explored is that for which the mechanical and magnetic Reynolds numbers are in the region of 100 to 1000. The conclusions are that mechanical forcing terms alone cannot lead to dynamo action, but that dynamo action can result from either magnetic forcing terms or from both mechanical and magnetic forcing terms simultaneously. Most real physical cases seem most accurately modelled by the third situation. The spatial resolution of the 32 × 32 calculation is not adequate to test accurately the predictions of the spectral power laws previously arrived at on the basis of the assumption of simultaneous cascades of energy and vector potential. Some speculations are offered concerning possible relations between turbulent cascades and the ‘disruptive instability’.},

              in the self-similar regime of magnetohydrodynamic

to 2048
              2
              grid points. The results are compared with the generalization of the 
parameter-free model derived by Galtier et al. [
              Phys. Rev. Lett.
              79
              , 2807 (1997)], 
which takes into account the slowing down of the dynamics due to the 
propagation of Alfvén waves. The new model developed here allows for a study 
in terms of one parameter governing the wavenumber dependence of the energy 
spectrum at scales of the order of (and larger than) the integral scale of the flow. 
The one-dimensional compressible case is also dealt with in two of its simplest 
configurations. Computations are performed for a standard Laplacian diffusion 
as well as with a hyperdiffusive algorithm. The results are sensitive to the 
amount of correlation between the velocity and the magnetic field, but rather 
insensitive to all other parameters such as the initial ratio of kinetic to magnetic 
energy or the presence or absence of a uniform component of the magnetic field. 
In all cases, the decay is significantly slower than for neutral fluids in a way that 
favours for MHD flows the phenomenology of Iroshnikov

The properties of the direct-interaction approximation are indicated.

	abstract = {To understand the turbulent generation of large-scale magnetic fields and to advance beyond purely kinematic approaches to the dynamo effect like that introduced by Steenbeck, Krause \& Radler (1966)’ a new nonlinear theory is developed for three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible MHD turbulence with helicity, i.e. not statistically invariant under plane reflexions. For this, techniques introduced for ordinary turbulence in recent years by Kraichnan (1971 a)’ Orszag (1970, 1976) and others are generalized to MHD; in particular we make use of the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian approximation. The resulting closed equations for the evolution of the kinetic and magnetic energy and helicity spectra are studied both theoretically and numerically in situations with high Reynolds number and unit magnetic Prandtl number.
            
              Interactions between widely separated scales are much more important than for non-magnetic turbulence. Large-scale magnetic energy brings to equipartition small-scale kinetic and magnetic excitation (energy or helicity) by the ‘Alfvén effect’; the small-scale ‘residual’ helicity, which is the difference between a purely kinetic and a purely magnetic helical term, induces growth of large-scale magnetic energy and helicity by the ‘helicity effect’. In the absence of helicity an inertial range occurs with a cascade of energy to small scales; to lowest order it is a −3/2 power law with equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energy spectra as in Kraichnan (1965) but there are −2 corrections (and possibly higher ones) leading to a slight excess of magnetic energy. When kinetic energy is continuously injected, an initial seed of magnetic field will grow to approximate equipartition, at least in the small scales. If in addition kinetic helicity is injected, an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is obtained leading to the appearance of magnetic energy and helicity in ever-increasing scales (in fact, limited by the size of the system). This inverse cascade, predicted by Frisch
              et al.
              (1975), results from a competition between the helicity and Alféh effects and yields an inertial range with approximately — 1 and — 2 power laws for magnetic energy and helicity. When kinetic helicity is injected at the scale l

	abstract = {The assumption of self-preservation permits an analytical determination of the energy decay in isotropic turbulence. Batchelor (1948), who was the first to carry out a detailed study of this problem, based his analysis on the assumption that the Loitsianskii integral is a dynamic invariant – a widely accepted hypothesis that was later discovered to be invalid. Nonetheless, it appears that the self-preserving isotropic decay problem has never been reinvestigated in depth subsequent to this earlier work. In the present paper such an analysis is carried out, yielding a much more complete picture of self-preserving isotropic turbulence. It is proven rigorously that complete self-preserving isotropic turbulence admits two general types of asymptotic solutions: one where the turbulent kinetic energy
              K
              ∼
              t
              −1
              and one where
              K
              ∼
              t
              −α
              with an exponent α {\textgreater} 1 that is determined explicitly by the initial conditions. By a fixed-point analysis and numerical integration of the exact one-point equations, it is demonstrated that the
              K
              ∼
              t
              −1
              power law decay is the asymptotically consistent high-Reynolds-number solution; the
              K
              ∼
              t
              −α
              decay law is only achieved in the limit as
              t
              → ∞ and the turbulence Reynolds number
              R
              
                t
              
              vanishes. Arguments are provided which indicate that a
              t
              −1
              power law decay is the asymptotic state toward which a complete self-preserving isotropic turbulence is driven at high Reynolds numbers in order to resolve an

              (ε is the rate of dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid). This leads to an estimate that makes the r.m.s. value of

	abstract = {Measurements of higher-order spectra of turbulent velocity fluctuations in the atmospheric boundary layer over the open ocean and land produce the interesting result that, in the wavenumber range designated originally by Kolmogorov as an inertial subrange, the functional dependence of the spectra on wavenumber is practically independent of the order of the spectrum. These results confirm the observation of Dutton \& Deaven that their extension by a dimensional similarity argument of the original Kolmogorov theory to higher-order spectra was not valid. In the present work, we derive an alternative generalization of the Kolmogorov ideas for spectra of arbitrary order. The results of this generalization describe the dependence upon wavenumber of the available data quite well. We also present theoretical calculations based on a Gaussian model for the fluctuating velocity field which furnish quantitative predictions for spectra of arbitrary order that are also in good agreement with the measurements, both in functional form and in absolute value.
            Comparison of results based on the Gaussian model with laboratory measurements obtained in a free shear layer shows that the Gaussian theory predicts accurately all the available normalized higher-order spectra for all frequencies. When the corresponding measured higher-order moments are close to those expected for a Gaussian process, the Gaussian theory also correctly predicts the absolute magnitudes of the higher-order spectra.},

	abstract = {The equations of high- and low-beta reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) are considered anew in order to elucidate the relationship between compressible MHD and RMHD and also to distinguish RMHD from recently developed models of nearly incompressible MHD. Our results, summarized in two theorems, provide the conditions under which RMHD represents a valid reduction of compressible MHD. The equations for low-beta RMHD and high-beta RMHD are shown to be identical. Furthermore, as a direct consequence of our analysis, the conditions under which both two-dimensional incompressible MHD (in terms of the spatial co-ordinates as well as the fluid variables) and 2½ dimensional incompressible MHD (i.e. only two-dimensional in the spatial co-ordinates) represent a valid reduction of three-dimensional compressible MHD are also formulated. It is found that the elimination of all high-frequency and long-wavelength modes from the magneto-fluid reduces the fully compressible MHD equations to either two-dimensional incompressible MHD in the plasma beta (β) limit β ≪ 1, or 2½-dimensional incompressible MHD for β ≈ 1. Our approach clarifies several inconsistencies to be found in previous investigations in that the reduction is exact. Our results and analysis are expected to be of interest for plasma fusion and space and solar physics.},

Then, the detailed physical processes involving energy transfer and interacting scales in isotropic turbulence, including triad interactions, are reviewed. The inertial range and self-similarity are also discussed along with the response of the small scales to large-scale anisotropy and the final stages of the decay process. Results from direct and large-eddy simulations of isotropic turbulence—including a discussion of subgrid scale modeling—are then discussed in detail to illustrate these points.

	abstract = {This is the first book specifically designed to offer the student a smooth transitionary course between elementary fluid dynamics (which gives only last-minute attention to turbulence) and the professional literature on turbulent flow, where an advanced viewpoint is assumed. The subject of turbulence, the most forbidding in fluid dynamics, has usually proved treacherous to the beginner, caught in the whirls and eddies of its nonlinearities and statistical imponderables. This is the first book specifically designed to offer the student a smooth transitionary course between elementary fluid dynamics (which gives only last-minute attention to turbulence) and the professional literature on turbulent flow, where an advanced viewpoint is assumed. Moreover, the text has been developed for students, engineers, and scientists with different technical backgrounds and interests. Almost all flows, natural and man-made, are turbulent. Thus the subject is the concern of geophysical and environmental scientists (in dealing with atmospheric jet streams, ocean currents, and the flow of rivers, for example), of astrophysicists (in studying the photospheres of the sun and stars or mapping gaseous nebulae), and of engineers (in calculating pipe flows, jets, or wakes). Many such examples are discussed in the book. The approach taken avoids the difficulties of advanced mathematical development on the one side and the morass of experimental detail and empirical data on the other. As a result of following its midstream course, the text gives the student a physical understanding of the subject and deepens his intuitive insight into those problems that cannot now be rigorously solved. In particular, dimensional analysis is used extensively in dealing with those problems whose exact solution is mathematically elusive. Dimensional reasoning, scale arguments, and similarity rules are introduced at the beginning and are applied throughout. A discussion of Reynolds stress and the kinetic theory of gases provides the contrast needed to put mixing-length theory into proper perspective: the authors present a thorough comparison between the mixing-length models and dimensional analysis of shear flows. This is followed by an extensive treatment of vorticity dynamics, including vortex stretching and vorticity budgets. Two chapters are devoted to boundary-free shear flows and well-bounded turbulent shear flows. The examples presented include wakes, jets, shear layers, thermal plumes, atmospheric boundary layers, pipe and channel flow, and boundary layers in pressure gradients. The spatial structure of turbulent flow has been the subject of analysis in the book up to this point, at which a compact but thorough introduction to statistical methods is given. This prepares the reader to understand the stochastic and spectral structure of turbulence. The remainder of the book consists of applications of the statistical approach to the study of turbulent transport (including diffusion and mixing) and turbulent spectra.},

	abstract = {A recapitulation is first given of a recent theory of homogeneous turbulence based on the condition that the Fourier amplitudes of the velocity field be as randomly distributed as the dynamical equations permit. This theory involves the average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes and employs a new kind of perturbation method which yields what are belived to be exact expansions of third- and higher-order statistical moments of the Fourier amplitudes in terms of second-order moments and these response functions.In the present paper the theory is applied in lowest approximation (called the direct-interaction approximation) to stationary isotropic turbulence of very high Reynolds number. The characteristic wave-number k0=ϵ{\textbar}v03k\_0 = {\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbar}v{\textasciicircum}3\_0 and Reynolds number R0=v0k0−1{\textbar}vR\_0 = v\_0 k{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\_0 {\textbar}v where v0 is the r.m.s. velocity in any given direction, ε is the power dissipated per unit mass, and ν is the kinematic viscosity, are introduced. For R013≫1R{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\}\{3\}\}\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1 it is found that the inertial and dissipation ranges extend over wave-numbers k satisfying k0 [Lt ] k [Lt ] R0k0. The time-correlation and average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes in these ranges are evaluated. They are found to be asymptotically identical and given by J1(2v0kτ)/v0kτ, where τ is the time interval.The energy spectrum in these ranges is determined by a non-linear integral equation, involving the time-correlation and response functions, which is suitable for solution by iteration. The solution is of the form E(k)/v0v = (k/kd) −32{\textasciicircum}\{- {\textbackslash}frac \{3\} \{2\}\} f(k/kd), where E(k) is the three-dimensional spectrum function kd=R023k0k\_d = R{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{2\}\{3\}\}\_0 k\_0 is a wave-number characterizing the dissipation range, and f(k/kd) is a universal function. In the inertial range, E(k) = f(0) (ε V0)½ k−32 k{\textasciicircum}\{- {\textbackslash}frac \{3\} \{2\}\}, asymptotically. Theparameter f(0) can be obtained by quadratures, without solving the integral equation for E(k). Spectral energy transport throughout the inertial and dissipation ranges is found to proceed by a cascade process essentially local in wave-number space; the direct power delivered by all modes below k to all modes above k′ [Gt ] k is of order ε(k/k′)32 {\textasciicircum}\{ {\textbackslash}frac \{3\} \{2\}\} if k and k′ both lie within the inertial range. The mean-square velocity derivatives of all orders are found to be finite. For R013≫1R{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\}\{3\}\}\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1 the skewness factor of the distribution of the nth-order longitudinal velocity derivative is found to have the asymptotic form AnR0−16A\_n R{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}frac \{1\}\{6\}\}\_0 where An is a universal constant.The theory is compared with experiment and is found to be slightly better supported than the Kolmogorov theory. However, it is stressed that extreme caution must be exercised in interpreting the experimental evidence as support for either theory.An analysis is given of the relations between the Kolmogorov theory, Heisen-berg's heuristic theory, the analytical theories of Heisenberg and Chandrasekhar, the theories of Proudman \& Reid and Tatsumi, and the present theory.},

	abstract = {This paper is a review of the basic theoretical dynamical properties of an atmosphere with an extended temperature strongly bound by gravity. The review begins with the historical developments leading up to the realization that the only dynamical equilibrium of an atmosphere with extended temperature is supersonic expansion. It is shown that sufficient conditions for supersonic expansion are T(r) declining asymptotically less rapidly than 1/r, or the density at the base of the corona being less than N b given by (40) if no energy is available except through thermal conductivity, or the temperature falling within the limits given by (18) if T ∝ Nα-1 throughout the corona. Less extended temperatures lead to equilibria which are subsonic or static. The hypothetical case of a corona with no energy supply other than thermal conduction from its base is considered at some length because the equations may be solved by analytical methods and illustrate the transition from subsonic to supersonic equilibrium as the temperature becomes more extended. Comparison with the actual corona shows that the solar corona is actively heated for some distance into space by wave dissipation.The dynamical stability of the expanding atmosphere is demonstrated, and in a later section the radial propagation of acoustic and Alfvén waves through the atmosphere and wind is worked out. The calculations show that the magnetometer will probably detect waves more easily than the plasma instrument, but that both are needed to determine the mode and direction of the wave. An observer in the wind at the orbit of Earth can “listen” to disturbances generated in the corona near the sun and in turbulent regions in interplanetary space.The possibility that the solar corona is composed of small-scale filaments near the sun is considered. It is shown that such filamentary structure would not be seen at the orbit of Earth. It is pointed out that the expansion of a non-filamentary corona seems to lead to too high a calculated wind density at the orbit of Earth to agree with the present observations, unless T(r) is constant or increases with r. A filamentary corona, on the other hand, would give the observed wind density for declining T(r).It is shown that viscosity plays no important role in the expansion of an atmosphere either with or without a weak magnetic field. The termination of the solar wind, presumably between 10–103 AU, is discussed briefly. The interesting development here is the interplanetary Lαrecently observed, which may come from the interstellar neutral hydrogen drifting into the outer regions of the solar wind.Theory is at the present time concerned with the general dynamical principles which pertain to the expansion equilibrium of an atmosphere. It is to be expected that the rapid progress of direct observations of the corona and wind will soon permit more detailed studies to be carried out. It is important that the distinction between detailed empirical models and models intended to illustrate general principles be kept clearly in mind at all times.},

Characterizations of the turbulence have generally been based on incompressible homogeneous turbulence theory. However, recent observations show that the fluctuations undergo systematic temporal evolution, suggesting couplings to large-scale plasma and magnetic field inhomogeneities. Here we present in detail, and further develop, a theory of transport of small-scale solar wind MHD turbulence, the preliminary results of which have been recently reported (Zhou and Matthaeus, Geophysical Research Letters, 16, 755, 1989). Large-scale plasma velocity and magnetic fields are specified, and small-scale incompressible turbulence evolves in response to the associated inhomogeneities, as well as in accordance with modeled local nonlinear couplings. Dynamical equations based on a two length scale expansion are derived, from which the evolution of various wave number spectra may be computed, including magnetic and kinetic energies, cross helicity, induced electric field, and the corresponding helicities. Several simple analytic solutions predict, with increasing heliocentric distance, a decrease of the preponderance of outward traveling type Alfvénic fluctuations and a lowering of the small-scale kinetic to magnetic energy ratio of small scale. Both of these are consistent with Helios and Voyager observations. The theory provides a basis for further computations that may be compared with statistical features of solar wind observations.},

	abstract = {Recently developed transport theories for small-scale solar wind fluctuations explicitly treat convection, expansion, and other interactions with large-scale gradients, while separating nonlinear effects associated with triple correlations of the fluctuations. To close these models, approximations for the nonlinear terms are needed, since exact treatment of the triple correlations is tantamount to a full solution of the turbulence problem, which is unavailable even for the case of homogeneous turbulence. In this paper we present a framework, based on turbulence theory, to develop approximations for the local turbulence effects that are required in transport models. Two approaches are given, based on, first, Kolmogoroff-style dimensional analysis and, second, a wave number diffusion picture. Further extensions are given, including a unified approach to the Kolmogoroff and Kraichnan spectral theories, the inclusion of cross helicity, and a discussion of nonlinearities associated with the energy difference spectrum.},

	abstract = {Incompressible turbulent flows are investigated in the framework of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. All the field quantities vary with only two spatial dimensions. Equilibrium canonical distributions are determined in a phase space whose co-ordinates are the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier coefficients for the field variables. In the geometry considered, the magnetic field and fluid velocity have variable
              x
              and
              y
              components, and all field quantities are independent of
              z.
              Three constants of the motion are found (one of them new) which survive the truncation in Fourier space and permit the construction of canonical distributions with three independent temperatures. Spectral densities are calculated. One of the more novel physical effects is the appearance of macroscopic structures involving long wavelength, self-generated, magnetic fields (‘magnetic islands’) for a wide range of initial parameters. Current filaments show a tendency toward consolidation in much the same way that vorticity filaments do in the guiding-centre plasma case. In the presence of finite dissipation, energy cascades to higher wavenumbers can be accompanied by vector potential cascades to lower wavenumbers, in much the same way as, in the fluid dynamic (Navier-Stokes) case, energy cascades to lower wavenumbers accompany enstrophy cascades to higher wavenumbers. It is suggested that the techniques may be relevant to theories of the magnetic dynamo problem and to the generation of megagauss magnetic fields when pellets are irradiated by lasers.},

	abstract = {The equations of motion for turbulent two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flows are solved in the presence of finite viscosity and resistivity, for the case in which external forces (mechanical and/or magnetic) act on the fluid. The goal is to verify the existence of a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo effect which is represented mathematically by a substantial back-transfer of mean square vector potential to the longest allowed Fourier wavelengths. External forces consisting of a random part plus a fraction of the value at the previous time step are employed, after the manner of Lilly for the Navier–Stokes case. The regime explored is that for which the mechanical and magnetic Reynolds numbers are in the region of 100 to 1000. The conclusions are that mechanical forcing terms alone cannot lead to dynamo action, but that dynamo action can result from either magnetic forcing terms or from both mechanical and magnetic forcing terms simultaneously. Most real physical cases seem most accurately modelled by the third situation. The spatial resolution of the 32 × 32 calculation is not adequate to test accurately the predictions of the spectral power laws previously arrived at on the basis of the assumption of simultaneous cascades of energy and vector potential. Some speculations are offered concerning possible relations between turbulent cascades and the ‘disruptive instability’.},

which takes into account the slowing down of the dynamics due to the 
propagation of Alfvén waves. The new model developed here allows for a study 
in terms of one parameter governing the wavenumber dependence of the energy 
spectrum at scales of the order of (and larger than) the integral scale of the flow. 
The one-dimensional compressible case is also dealt with in two of its simplest 
configurations. Computations are performed for a standard Laplacian diffusion 
as well as with a hyperdiffusive algorithm. The results are sensitive to the 
amount of correlation between the velocity and the magnetic field, but rather 
insensitive to all other parameters such as the initial ratio of kinetic to magnetic 
energy or the presence or absence of a uniform component of the magnetic field. 
In all cases, the decay is significantly slower than for neutral fluids in a way that 
favours for MHD flows the phenomenology of Iroshnikov

	abstract = {To understand the turbulent generation of large-scale magnetic fields and to advance beyond purely kinematic approaches to the dynamo effect like that introduced by Steenbeck, Krause \& Radler (1966)’ a new nonlinear theory is developed for three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible MHD turbulence with helicity, i.e. not statistically invariant under plane reflexions. For this, techniques introduced for ordinary turbulence in recent years by Kraichnan (1971 a)’ Orszag (1970, 1976) and others are generalized to MHD; in particular we make use of the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian approximation. The resulting closed equations for the evolution of the kinetic and magnetic energy and helicity spectra are studied both theoretically and numerically in situations with high Reynolds number and unit magnetic Prandtl number.
            
              Interactions between widely separated scales are much more important than for non-magnetic turbulence. Large-scale magnetic energy brings to equipartition small-scale kinetic and magnetic excitation (energy or helicity) by the ‘Alfvén effect’; the small-scale ‘residual’ helicity, which is the difference between a purely kinetic and a purely magnetic helical term, induces growth of large-scale magnetic energy and helicity by the ‘helicity effect’. In the absence of helicity an inertial range occurs with a cascade of energy to small scales; to lowest order it is a −3/2 power law with equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energy spectra as in Kraichnan (1965) but there are −2 corrections (and possibly higher ones) leading to a slight excess of magnetic energy. When kinetic energy is continuously injected, an initial seed of magnetic field will grow to approximate equipartition, at least in the small scales. If in addition kinetic helicity is injected, an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is obtained leading to the appearance of magnetic energy and helicity in ever-increasing scales (in fact, limited by the size of the system). This inverse cascade, predicted by Frisch
              et al.
              (1975), results from a competition between the helicity and Alféh effects and yields an inertial range with approximately — 1 and — 2 power laws for magnetic energy and helicity. When kinetic helicity is injected at the scale l

	abstract = {The assumption of self-preservation permits an analytical determination of the energy decay in isotropic turbulence. Batchelor (1948), who was the first to carry out a detailed study of this problem, based his analysis on the assumption that the Loitsianskii integral is a dynamic invariant – a widely accepted hypothesis that was later discovered to be invalid. Nonetheless, it appears that the self-preserving isotropic decay problem has never been reinvestigated in depth subsequent to this earlier work. In the present paper such an analysis is carried out, yielding a much more complete picture of self-preserving isotropic turbulence. It is proven rigorously that complete self-preserving isotropic turbulence admits two general types of asymptotic solutions: one where the turbulent kinetic energy
              K
              ∼
              t
              −1
              and one where
              K
              ∼
              t
              −α
              with an exponent α {\textgreater} 1 that is determined explicitly by the initial conditions. By a fixed-point analysis and numerical integration of the exact one-point equations, it is demonstrated that the
              K
              ∼
              t
              −1
              power law decay is the asymptotically consistent high-Reynolds-number solution; the
              K
              ∼
              t
              −α
              decay law is only achieved in the limit as
              t
              → ∞ and the turbulence Reynolds number

                t

              t
              −1
              power law decay is the asymptotic state toward which a complete self-preserving isotropic turbulence is driven at high Reynolds numbers in order to resolve an

	abstract = {Measurements of higher-order spectra of turbulent velocity fluctuations in the atmospheric boundary layer over the open ocean and land produce the interesting result that, in the wavenumber range designated originally by Kolmogorov as an inertial subrange, the functional dependence of the spectra on wavenumber is practically independent of the order of the spectrum. These results confirm the observation of Dutton \& Deaven that their extension by a dimensional similarity argument of the original Kolmogorov theory to higher-order spectra was not valid. In the present work, we derive an alternative generalization of the Kolmogorov ideas for spectra of arbitrary order. The results of this generalization describe the dependence upon wavenumber of the available data quite well. We also present theoretical calculations based on a Gaussian model for the fluctuating velocity field which furnish quantitative predictions for spectra of arbitrary order that are also in good agreement with the measurements, both in functional form and in absolute value.
            Comparison of results based on the Gaussian model with laboratory measurements obtained in a free shear layer shows that the Gaussian theory predicts accurately all the available normalized higher-order spectra for all frequencies. When the corresponding measured higher-order moments are close to those expected for a Gaussian process, the Gaussian theory also correctly predicts the absolute magnitudes of the higher-order spectra.},

	abstract = {The equations of high- and low-beta reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) are considered anew in order to elucidate the relationship between compressible MHD and RMHD and also to distinguish RMHD from recently developed models of nearly incompressible MHD. Our results, summarized in two theorems, provide the conditions under which RMHD represents a valid reduction of compressible MHD. The equations for low-beta RMHD and high-beta RMHD are shown to be identical. Furthermore, as a direct consequence of our analysis, the conditions under which both two-dimensional incompressible MHD (in terms of the spatial co-ordinates as well as the fluid variables) and 2½ dimensional incompressible MHD (i.e. only two-dimensional in the spatial co-ordinates) represent a valid reduction of three-dimensional compressible MHD are also formulated. It is found that the elimination of all high-frequency and long-wavelength modes from the magneto-fluid reduces the fully compressible MHD equations to either two-dimensional incompressible MHD in the plasma beta (β) limit β ≪ 1, or 2½-dimensional incompressible MHD for β ≈ 1. Our approach clarifies several inconsistencies to be found in previous investigations in that the reduction is exact. Our results and analysis are expected to be of interest for plasma fusion and space and solar physics.},

The inertial range and self-similarity are also discussed along with the response of the small scales to large-scale anisotropy and the final stages of the decay process. Results from direct and large-eddy simulations of isotropic turbulence—including a discussion of subgrid scale modeling—are then discussed in detail to illustrate these points.

	abstract = {This is the first book specifically designed to offer the student a smooth transitionary course between elementary fluid dynamics (which gives only last-minute attention to turbulence) and the professional literature on turbulent flow, where an advanced viewpoint is assumed. The subject of turbulence, the most forbidding in fluid dynamics, has usually proved treacherous to the beginner, caught in the whirls and eddies of its nonlinearities and statistical imponderables. This is the first book specifically designed to offer the student a smooth transitionary course between elementary fluid dynamics (which gives only last-minute attention to turbulence) and the professional literature on turbulent flow, where an advanced viewpoint is assumed. Moreover, the text has been developed for students, engineers, and scientists with different technical backgrounds and interests. Almost all flows, natural and man-made, are turbulent. Thus the subject is the concern of geophysical and environmental scientists (in dealing with atmospheric jet streams, ocean currents, and the flow of rivers, for example), of astrophysicists (in studying the photospheres of the sun and stars or mapping gaseous nebulae), and of engineers (in calculating pipe flows, jets, or wakes). Many such examples are discussed in the book. The approach taken avoids the difficulties of advanced mathematical development on the one side and the morass of experimental detail and empirical data on the other. As a result of following its midstream course, the text gives the student a physical understanding of the subject and deepens his intuitive insight into those problems that cannot now be rigorously solved. In particular, dimensional analysis is used extensively in dealing with those problems whose exact solution is mathematically elusive. Dimensional reasoning, scale arguments, and similarity rules are introduced at the beginning and are applied throughout. A discussion of Reynolds stress and the kinetic theory of gases provides the contrast needed to put mixing-length theory into proper perspective: the authors present a thorough comparison between the mixing-length models and dimensional analysis of shear flows. This is followed by an extensive treatment of vorticity dynamics, including vortex stretching and vorticity budgets. Two chapters are devoted to boundary-free shear flows and well-bounded turbulent shear flows. The examples presented include wakes, jets, shear layers, thermal plumes, atmospheric boundary layers, pipe and channel flow, and boundary layers in pressure gradients. The spatial structure of turbulent flow has been the subject of analysis in the book up to this point, at which a compact but thorough introduction to statistical methods is given. This prepares the reader to understand the stochastic and spectral structure of turbulence. The remainder of the book consists of applications of the statistical approach to the study of turbulent transport (including diffusion and mixing) and turbulent spectra.},

The cascade process due to the nonlinear interaction of the turbulent modes, effectively transfers energy to even shorter wavenumbers until Joule effect becomes dominant and converts the cascading magnetic energy into heat.Assuming that a stationary spectrum is established, we show that MHD turbulence naturally provides a way of enhancing the Joule dissipation of macroscopic magnetic stresses and a heating rate can be derived.},

	abstract = {A recapitulation is first given of a recent theory of homogeneous turbulence based on the condition that the Fourier amplitudes of the velocity field be as randomly distributed as the dynamical equations permit. This theory involves the average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes and employs a new kind of perturbation method which yields what are belived to be exact expansions of third- and higher-order statistical moments of the Fourier amplitudes in terms of second-order moments and these response functions.In the present paper the theory is applied in lowest approximation (called the direct-interaction approximation) to stationary isotropic turbulence of very high Reynolds number. The characteristic wave-number k0=ϵ{\textbar}v03k\_0 = {\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbar}v{\textasciicircum}3\_0 and Reynolds number R0=v0k0−1{\textbar}vR\_0 = v\_0 k{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\_0 {\textbar}v where v0 is the r.m.s. velocity in any given direction, ε is the power dissipated per unit mass, and ν is the kinematic viscosity, are introduced. For R013≫1R{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\}\{3\}\}\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1 it is found that the inertial and dissipation ranges extend over wave-numbers k satisfying k0 [Lt ] k [Lt ] R0k0. The time-correlation and average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes in these ranges are evaluated. They are found to be asymptotically identical and given by J1(2v0kτ)/v0kτ, where τ is the time interval.The energy spectrum in these ranges is determined by a non-linear integral equation, involving the time-correlation and response functions, which is suitable for solution by iteration. The solution is of the form E(k)/v0v = (k/kd) −32{\textasciicircum}\{- {\textbackslash}frac \{3\} \{2\}\} f(k/kd), where E(k) is the three-dimensional spectrum function kd=R023k0k\_d = R{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{2\}\{3\}\}\_0 k\_0 is a wave-number characterizing the dissipation range, and f(k/kd) is a universal function. In the inertial range, E(k) = f(0) (ε V0)½ k−32 k{\textasciicircum}\{- {\textbackslash}frac \{3\} \{2\}\}, asymptotically. Theparameter f(0) can be obtained by quadratures, without solving the integral equation for E(k). Spectral energy transport throughout the inertial and dissipation ranges is found to proceed by a cascade process essentially local in wave-number space; the direct power delivered by all modes below k to all modes above k′ [Gt ] k is of order ε(k/k′)32 {\textasciicircum}\{ {\textbackslash}frac \{3\} \{2\}\} if k and k′ both lie within the inertial range. The mean-square velocity derivatives of all orders are found to be finite. For R013≫1R{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\}\{3\}\}\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1 the skewness factor of the distribution of the nth-order longitudinal velocity derivative is found to have the asymptotic form AnR0−16A\_n R{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}frac \{1\}\{6\}\}\_0 where An is a universal constant.The theory is compared with experiment and is found to be slightly better supported than the Kolmogorov theory. However, it is stressed that extreme caution must be exercised in interpreting the experimental evidence as support for either theory.An analysis is given of the relations between the Kolmogorov theory, Heisen-berg's heuristic theory, the analytical theories of Heisenberg and Chandrasekhar, the theories of Proudman \& Reid and Tatsumi, and the present theory.},

	abstract = {This paper is a review of the basic theoretical dynamical properties of an atmosphere with an extended temperature strongly bound by gravity. The review begins with the historical developments leading up to the realization that the only dynamical equilibrium of an atmosphere with extended temperature is supersonic expansion. It is shown that sufficient conditions for supersonic expansion are T(r) declining asymptotically less rapidly than 1/r, or the density at the base of the corona being less than N b given by (40) if no energy is available except through thermal conductivity, or the temperature falling within the limits given by (18) if T ∝ Nα-1 throughout the corona. Less extended temperatures lead to equilibria which are subsonic or static. The hypothetical case of a corona with no energy supply other than thermal conduction from its base is considered at some length because the equations may be solved by analytical methods and illustrate the transition from subsonic to supersonic equilibrium as the temperature becomes more extended. Comparison with the actual corona shows that the solar corona is actively heated for some distance into space by wave dissipation.The dynamical stability of the expanding atmosphere is demonstrated, and in a later section the radial propagation of acoustic and Alfvén waves through the atmosphere and wind is worked out. The calculations show that the magnetometer will probably detect waves more easily than the plasma instrument, but that both are needed to determine the mode and direction of the wave. An observer in the wind at the orbit of Earth can “listen” to disturbances generated in the corona near the sun and in turbulent regions in interplanetary space.The possibility that the solar corona is composed of small-scale filaments near the sun is considered. It is shown that such filamentary structure would not be seen at the orbit of Earth. It is pointed out that the expansion of a non-filamentary corona seems to lead to too high a calculated wind density at the orbit of Earth to agree with the present observations, unless T(r) is constant or increases with r. A filamentary corona, on the other hand, would give the observed wind density for declining T(r).It is shown that viscosity plays no important role in the expansion of an atmosphere either with or without a weak magnetic field. The termination of the solar wind, presumably between 10–103 AU, is discussed briefly. The interesting development here is the interplanetary Lαrecently observed, which may come from the interstellar neutral hydrogen drifting into the outer regions of the solar wind.Theory is at the present time concerned with the general dynamical principles which pertain to the expansion equilibrium of an atmosphere. It is to be expected that the rapid progress of direct observations of the corona and wind will soon permit more detailed studies to be carried out. It is important that the distinction between detailed empirical models and models intended to illustrate general principles be kept clearly in mind at all times.},

	abstract = {Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) activity, including waves and turbulence, has been a focus of attention in solar wind research for several decades, owing to the wealth of available relevant spacecraft observations. Characterizations of the turbulence have generally been based on incompressible homogeneous turbulence theory. However, recent observations show that the fluctuations undergo systematic temporal evolution, suggesting couplings to large-scale plasma and magnetic field inhomogeneities. Here we present in detail, and further develop, a theory of transport of small-scale solar wind MHD turbulence, the preliminary results of which have been recently reported (Zhou and Matthaeus, Geophysical Research Letters, 16, 755, 1989). Large-scale plasma velocity and magnetic fields are specified, and small-scale incompressible turbulence evolves in response to the associated inhomogeneities, as well as in accordance with modeled local nonlinear couplings. Dynamical equations based on a two length scale expansion are derived, from which the evolution of various wave number spectra may be computed, including magnetic and kinetic energies, cross helicity, induced electric field, and the corresponding helicities. Several simple analytic solutions predict, with increasing heliocentric distance, a decrease of the preponderance of outward traveling type Alfvénic fluctuations and a lowering of the small-scale kinetic to magnetic energy ratio of small scale. Both of these are consistent with Helios and Voyager observations. The theory provides a basis for further computations that may be compared with statistical features of solar wind observations.},

To close these models, approximations for the nonlinear terms are needed, since exact treatment of the triple correlations is tantamount to a full solution of the turbulence problem, which is unavailable even for the case of homogeneous turbulence. In this paper we present a framework, based on turbulence theory, to develop approximations for the local turbulence effects that are required in transport models. Two approaches are given, based on, first, Kolmogoroff-style dimensional analysis and, second, a wave number diffusion picture. Further extensions are given, including a unified approach to the Kolmogoroff and Kraichnan spectral theories, the inclusion of cross helicity, and a discussion of nonlinearities associated with the energy difference spectrum.},

	abstract = {This textbook presents a modern account of turbulence, one of the greatest challenges in physics. The state-of-the-art is put into historical perspective five centuries after the first studies of Leonardo and half a century after the first attempt by A.N. Kolmogorov to predict the properties of flow at very high Reynolds numbers. Such "fully developed turbulence" is ubiquitous in both cosmical and natural environments, in engineering applications and in everyday life. First, a qualitative introduction is given to bring out the need for a probabilistic description of what is in essence a deterministic system. Kolmogorov's 1941 theory is presented in a novel fashion with emphasis on symmetries (including scaling transformations) which are broken by the mechanisms producing the turbulence and restored by the chaotic character of the cascade to small scales. Considerable material is devoted to intermittency, the clumpiness of small-scale activity, which has led to the development of fractal and multifractal models. Such models, pioneered by B. Mandelbrot, have applications in numerous fields besides turbulence (diffusion limited aggregation, solid-earth geophysics, attractors of dynamical systems, etc). The final chapter contains an introduction to analytic theories of the sort pioneered by R. Kraichnan, to the modern theory of eddy transport and renormalization and to recent developments in the statistical theory of two-dimensional turbulence. The book concludes with a guide to further reading. The intended readership for the book ranges from first-year graduate students in mathematics, physics, astrophysics, geosciences and engineering, to professional scientists and engineers.},

We present, for the first time, direct evidence of such a transition using a decaying three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of incompressible balanced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with a grid resolution of 30722{\texttimes}256. From large to small scales, the change of regime is characterized by (i) a change of slope in the energy spectrum going from approximately -2 to -3/2, (ii) an increase of the ratio between the wave and nonlinear times, with a critical ratio of $\chi$c\~{}1/3, (iii) a modification of the isocontours of energy revealing a transition from a purely perpendicular cascade to a cascade compatible with the critical-balance-type phenomenology, and (iv) an absence followed by a dramatic increase of the communication between Alfv{\'e}n modes. The changes happen at approximately the same transition scale and can be seen as manifest signatures of the transition from weak to strong wave turbulence. Furthermore, we observe a significant nonlocal three-wave coupling between strongly and weakly nonlinear modes resulting in an inverse transfer of energy from small to large scales.},

In slow solar wind, the decorrelation time is 215 {\textpm} 43 min, and in fast solar wind, the decorrelation time scale is 114 {\textpm} 23 min, which indicates that decorrelation times vary with the nature of the turbulence. The values reported here are comparable to estimates of decorrelation times based on a number of different models, but do not clearly support or refute any specific solar wind turbulence model.

	abstract = {To understand the turbulent generation of large-scale magnetic fields and to advance beyond purely kinematic approaches to the dynamo effect like that introduced by Steenbeck, Krause \& Radler (1966){\textquoteright} a new nonlinear theory is developed for three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible MHD turbulence with helicity, i.e. not statistically invariant under plane reflexions. For this, techniques introduced for ordinary turbulence in recent years by Kraichnan (1971 a){\textquoteright} Orszag (1970, 1976) and others are generalized to MHD; in particular we make use of the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian approximation. The resulting closed equations for the evolution of the kinetic and magnetic energy and helicity spectra are studied both theoretically and numerically in situations with high Reynolds number and unit magnetic Prandtl number.Interactions between widely separated scales are much more important than for non-magnetic turbulence. Large-scale magnetic energy brings to equipartition small-scale kinetic and magnetic excitation (energy or helicity) by the {\textquoteleft}Alfv{\'e}n effect{\textquoteright}; the small-scale {\textquoteleft}residual{\textquoteright} helicity, which is the difference between a purely kinetic and a purely magnetic helical term, induces growth of large-scale magnetic energy and helicity by the {\textquoteleft}helicity effect{\textquoteright}. In the absence of helicity an inertial range occurs with a cascade of energy to small scales; to lowest order it is a -3/2 power law with equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energy spectra as in Kraichnan (1965) but there are -2 corrections (and possibly higher ones) leading to a slight excess of magnetic energy. When kinetic energy is continuously injected, an initial seed of magnetic field will grow to approximate equipartition, at least in the small scales. If in addition kinetic helicity is injected, an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is obtained leading to the appearance of magnetic energy and helicity in ever-increasing scales (in fact, limited by the size of the system). This inverse cascade, predicted by Frisch et al. (1975), results from a competition between the helicity and Alf{\'e}h effects and yields an inertial range with approximately {\textemdash} 1 and {\textemdash} 2 power laws for magnetic energy and helicity. When kinetic helicity is injected at the scale linj and the rate \${\textbackslash}tilde{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}V\$ (per unit mass), the time of build-up of magnetic energy with scale L >> linj is \$t {\textbackslash}approx L({\textbar}{\textbackslash}tilde{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}V{\textbar}l{\textasciicircum}2\_{\textbackslash}rm inj){\textasciicircum}-1/3.\$},

	abstract = {A recapitulation is first given of a recent theory of homogeneous turbulence based on the condition that the Fourier amplitudes of the velocity field be as randomly distributed as the dynamical equations permit. This theory involves the average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes and employs a new kind of perturbation method which yields what are belived to be exact expansions of third- and higher-order statistical moments of the Fourier amplitudes in terms of second-order moments and these response functions.In the present paper the theory is applied in lowest approximation (called the direct-interaction approximation) to stationary isotropic turbulence of very high Reynolds number. The characteristic wave-number \$k\_0 = {\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbar}v{\textasciicircum}3\_0\$ and Reynolds number \$R\_0 = v\_0 k{\textasciicircum}-1\_0 {\textbar}v\$ where v0 is the r.m.s. velocity in any given direction, $\varepsilon$ is the power dissipated per unit mass, and $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, are introduced. For \$R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac 13\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1\$ it is found that the inertial and dissipation ranges extend over wave-numbers k satisfying k0 << k << R0k0. The time-correlation and average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes in these ranges are evaluated. They are found to be asymptotically identical and given by J1(2v0k$\tau$)/v0k$\tau$, where $\tau$ is the time interval.The energy spectrum in these ranges is determined by a non-linear integral equation, involving the time-correlation and response functions, which is suitable for solution by iteration. The solution is of the form E(k)/v0v = (k/kd) \${\textasciicircum}- {\textbackslash}frac 3 2\$ f(k/kd), where E(k) is the three-dimensional spectrum function \$k\_d = R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac 23\_0 k\_0\$ is a wave-number characterizing the dissipation range, and f(k/kd) is a universal function. In the inertial range, E(k) = f(0) ($\varepsilon$ V0){\textonehalf} \$ k{\textasciicircum}- {\textbackslash}frac 3 2\$, asymptotically. Theparameter f(0) can be obtained by quadratures, without solving the integral equation for E(k). Spectral energy transport throughout the inertial and dissipation ranges is found to proceed by a cascade process essentially local in wave-number space; the direct power delivered by all modes below k to all modes above k' >> k is of order $\varepsilon$(k/k')\$ {\textasciicircum} {\textbackslash}frac 3 2\$ if k and k' both lie within the inertial range. The mean-square velocity derivatives of all orders are found to be finite. For \$R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac 13\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1\$ the skewness factor of the distribution of the nth-order longitudinal velocity derivative is found to have the asymptotic form \$A\_n R{\textasciicircum}-{\textbackslash}frac 16\_0\$ where An is a universal constant.The theory is compared with experiment and is found to be slightly better supported than the Kolmogorov theory. However, it is stressed that extreme caution must be exercised in interpreting the experimental evidence as support for either theory.An analysis is given of the relations between the Kolmogorov theory, Heisen-berg's heuristic theory, the analytical theories of Heisenberg and Chandrasekhar, the theories of Proudman \& Reid and Tatsumi, and the present theory.},

In this paper, we review some recent results in the study of locality of interactions in turbulent flows and we address some of the questions that arise. We examine the cascade of ideal invariants in turbulent MHD flows by examining the transfer functions. We show new results indicating that the nonlocal behaviour of the energy transfer in MHD is the result of a correlation between the velocity and magnetic fields. This nonlocality disappears if we randomize the phases of the two fields keeping the hydrodynamic and magnetic helicities fixed. The cascade of magnetic helicity is also investigated, with special focus on the fate of the small-scale helicity and its coupling with the large-scale flow. These results have implications for dynamo action, in particular for the commonly used distinction between large- and small-scale dynamos. The long-range interactions that exist in MHD flows also raise the question of the existence of universality in MHD, both in the kinematic dynamo regime as well as in the turbulent steady state.},

Turbulence is the archetypal non-linear, non-equilibrium problem of statistical physics; the fundamental problems of turbulence are still unsolved, but there is a growing interest in their solution. This book aims to look at fluid turbulence from the point of view of engineering science and physics to produce an integrated treatise on the nature of the physics of fluid turbulence as a universal phenomenon with a universal behaviour. It is designed for those who are new to the subject and also for those familiar with the more traditional branches of the study of turbulence but not with the usages of quantum physics. For the first group of readers, a concise summary of the theory and practice of turbulence up to about 1960 is given as an introduction. This is followed by a detailed analysis of modern (post 1960) turbulence theory, including rigorous formulation of the turbulence problem as an example of a non-equilibrium statistical system with strong coupling and the application of renormalized perturbation theory to turbulence.},

After reviewing the properties which make spectral (Galerkin) and pseudospectral methods particularly useful for incompressible turbulence simulations, we consider how well these methods carry over to the compressible case. Major obstacles exist in formulating algorithms using the Galerkin method. In spite of the presence of aliasing errors, the pseudospectral method can be used to write algorithms that conserve a number of important global quantities. Accordingly, we suggest pseudospectral forms for a polytropic MHD model. Finally, a pseudospectral algorithm for the ideal gas MHD model is suggested. This algorithm conserves energy in terms of the dynamical fluid variables and not, as is common practice, due to a separate energy equation written in conservative form.},

However, for modes for which the period of the inertial waves $\tau$$\omega$ is faster than the turnover time $\tau$ NL , a significant fraction of the remaining energy is concentrated in the modes that satisfy the dispersion relation of the waves. No evidence of accumulation of energy in the modes with $\tau$ $\omega$ = $\tau$ NL is observed, unlike what critical balance arguments predict. From the time correlation functions, we find that for modes with $\tau$ $\omega$ \&lt; $\tau$ sw (with $\tau$ sw the sweeping time) the dominant decorrelation time is the wave period, and that these modes also show a slower modulation on the timescale $\tau$ NL as assumed in wave turbulence theories.

	abstract = {We study weak Alfvenic turbulence of an incompressible, magnetized fluid in some detail, with a view to developing a firm theoretical basis for the dynamics of small-scale turbulence in the interstellar medium. We prove that resonant 3-wave interactions are absent. We also show that the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan theory of incompressible, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence -- which is widely accepted -- describes weak 3-wave
turbulence; consequently, it is incorrect. Physical arguments, as well as detailed calculations of the coupling coefficients are used to demonstrate that these interactions are empty. We then examine resonant 4-wave interactions, and show that the resonance relations forbid energy transport to small spatial scales along the direction of the mean magnetic field, for both the shear Alfven wave and the pseudo Alfven wave. The three-dimensional inertial-range energy spectrum of 4-wave shear Alfven turbulence guessed from physical arguments reads
E(kz, kperpendicular) approximately
VAvLL-1/3kperpendicular-10/3, where VA is the Alfven speed, and vL is the velocity difference across the outer scale L. Given this spectrum, the velocity difference across lambdaperpendicular approximately kperpendicular exp -1 is vlambda (sub
perpendicular) is approximately
vL(lambdaperpendicular/L)2/3. We derive a kinetic equation, and prove that this energy spectrum is a stationary solution and that it implies a positive flux of energy in k-space, along directions perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Using this energy spectrum, we deduce that 4-wave interactions strengthen as the energy cascades to small, perpendicular spatial scales; beyond an upper bound in perpendicular wavenumber, kperpendicularL is approximately (VA/vL)3/2, weak turbulence theory ceases to be valid. Energy excitation amplitudes must be very small for the 4-wave inertial-range to be substantial. When the excitation is strong, the width of the 4-wave inertial-range shrinks to zero. This seems likely to be the case in the interstellar medium.},

A method of decomposing the spectral space into ring structures is presented and the energy transfers between such rings are studied. This decomposition method takes into account the angular dependency of energy transfers in anisotropic systems, while it allows one to recover easily the known shell-to-shell energy transfers in the limit of isotropic turbulence. For large values of the constant magnetic field, the total-energy transfer appears to be most dominant in the direction perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. The linear transfer due to the constant magnetic also appears to be important in redistributing the energy between the velocity and the magnetic fields.},

Fluid Mech. 6 7, 561 (1975)] estimated the time decorrelation of inertial-range excitation in isotropic turbulence by assuming effective statistical independence of the one-time distributions of inertial-range and energy-range excitation. This picture has been challenged by Yakhot, Orszag, and She [Phys. Fluids A 1, 184 (1989)], who studied forced turbulence by renormalization-group (RNG) methods. The analysis given in the present paper leads to the conclusion that (a) precise coherence between energy-range and inertial-range excitation is needed to inhibit sweeping effects; (b) in the case of randomly forced turbulence, this coherence is impossible and Tennekes{\textquoteright} picture is unavoidable; and (c) the RNG analysis does not demonstrate inhibition of sweeping; instead, it discards sweeping effects at the outset. To augment the present study, an advected passive scalar is examined by computer simulation. Sweeping effects on small scales survive even in the case of long-time advection by a frozen velocity field. The observed probability distributions resemble those for the alignment of vorticity and velocity observed in flow simulations.},

The results are based on a detailed analysis of three-dimensional numerical flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. The energy transfer functions, as well as the global and partial fluxes, are examined by means of different geometrical wave number shells. On the one hand, the transfer functions of the two conserved Els{\"a}sser energies E+ and E- are found local in both the directions parallel (k{\textbardbl} direction) and perpendicular (k? direction) to the magnetic guide field, whatever the B strength. On the other hand, from the flux analysis, the interactions between the two counterpropagating Els{\"a}sser waves become nonlocal. Indeed, as the B intensity is increased, local interactions are strongly decreased and the interactions with small k{\textbardbl} modes dominate the cascade. Most of the energy flux in the k? direction is due to modes in the plane at k{\textbardbl}=0, while the weaker cascade in the k{\textbardbl} direction is due to the modes with k{\textbardbl}=1. The stronger magnetized flows tend thus to get closer to the weak turbulence limit, where three-wave resonant interactions are dominant. Hence, the transition from the strong to the weak turbulence regime occurs by reducing the number of effective modes in the energy cascade.},

Recent observations from Yohkoh and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and a reanalysis of older observations from the Solar Maximum Mission, have led to important new results concerning the location, timing, and efficiency of particle acceleration in flares. These are summarized in the first part of the review. Particle acceleration processes are then discussed, with particular emphasis on new developments in stochastic acceleration by magnetohydrodynamic waves and direct electric field acceleration by both sub- and super-Dreicer electric fields. Finally, issues that arise when these mechanisms are incorporated into the large-scale flare structure are considered. Stochastic and super-Dreicer acceleration may occur either in a single large coronal reconnection site or at multiple {\textquotedblleft}fragmented{\textquotedblright} energy release sites. Sub-Dreicer acceleration requires a highly filamented coronal current pattern. A particular issue that needs to be confronted by all theories is the apparent need for large magnetic field strengths in the flare energy release region.},

At leading order, this asymptotic regime is achieved via three-wave resonant interactions with the scattering of a wave on a 2D mode for which \$k\_{\textbackslash}Vert =0\$ . When the interactions with the 2D modes are artificially reduced, we show numerically that the system exhibits an energy spectrum with \$k\_{\textbackslash}bot {\textasciicircum}-3/2\$ , whereas the expected exact solution with \$k\_{\textbackslash}bot {\textasciicircum}-2\$ is recovered with the full nonlinear system. In the latter case, strong intermittency is found when the vector separation of structure functions is taken transverse to \${\textbackslash}boldsymbolb\_{\textbackslash}mathbf0\$ . This result may be explained by the influence of the 2D modes whose regime belongs to strong turbulence. In addition to shedding light on the origin of this intermittency, we derive a log-Poisson law, \${\i}t{\textbackslash}zeta\_p=p/8+1-(1/4){\textasciicircum}p/2\$ , which fits the data perfectly and highlights the important role of parallel current sheets.},

The present-day increase of computing power, which allows for the exploration of different configurations of turbulence in conducting flows, and the development of shell-to-shell transfer functions, has led to detailed studies of interactions between the velocity and the magnetic field and between scales. In particular, processes such as induction and dynamo action, the damping of velocity fluctuations by the Lorentz force, and the development of anisotropies can be characterized at different scales. In this context we consider three different configurations often studied in the literature: mechanically forced turbulence, freely decaying turbulence, and turbulence in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. Each configuration is of interest for different geophysical and astrophysical applications. Local and nonlocal transfers are discussed for each case. Whereas the transfer between scales of solely kinetic or solely magnetic energy is local, transfers between kinetic and magnetic fields are observed to be local or nonlocal depending on the configuration. Scale interactions in the cascade of magnetic helicity are also reviewed. Based on the results, the validity of several usual assumptions in hydrodynamic turbulence, such as isotropy of the small scales or universality, is discussed.},

We show how to compute and analyse the spatio-temporal spectrum from data stemming from numerical simulations and from laboratory experiments. Four cases are considered: homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, rotating turbulence, stratified turbulence, and water wave turbulence. For homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the spectrum allows identification of sweeping by the large-scale flow. For rotating and for stratified turbulence, the spectrum allows identification of the waves, precise quantification of the energy in the waves and in the turbulent eddies, and identification of physical mechanisms such as Doppler shift and wave absorption in critical layers. Finally, in water wave turbulence the spectrum shows a transition from gravity-capillary waves to bound waves as the amplitude of the forcing is increased. Graphical abstract},

	abstract = {This textbook presents a modern account of turbulence, one of the greatest challenges in physics. The state-of-the-art is put into historical perspective five centuries after the first studies of Leonardo and half a century after the first attempt by A.N. Kolmogorov to predict the properties of flow at very high Reynolds numbers. Such "fully developed turbulence" is ubiquitous in both cosmical and natural environments, in engineering applications and in everyday life. First, a qualitative introduction is given to bring out the need for a probabilistic description of what is in essence a deterministic system. Kolmogorov's 1941 theory is presented in a novel fashion with emphasis on symmetries (including scaling transformations) which are broken by the mechanisms producing the turbulence and restored by the chaotic character of the cascade to small scales. Considerable material is devoted to intermittency, the clumpiness of small-scale activity, which has led to the development of fractal and multifractal models. Such models, pioneered by B. Mandelbrot, have applications in numerous fields besides turbulence (diffusion limited aggregation, solid-earth geophysics, attractors of dynamical systems, etc). The final chapter contains an introduction to analytic theories of the sort pioneered by R. Kraichnan, to the modern theory of eddy transport and renormalization and to recent developments in the statistical theory of two-dimensional turbulence. The book concludes with a guide to further reading. The intended readership for the book ranges from first-year graduate students in mathematics, physics, astrophysics, geosciences and engineering, to professional scientists and engineers.},

This transition is believed to be a universal property of several anisotropic turbulent systems. We present, for the first time, direct evidence of such a transition using a decaying three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of incompressible balanced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with a grid resolution of 30722{\texttimes}256. From large to small scales, the change of regime is characterized by (i) a change of slope in the energy spectrum going from approximately -2 to -3/2, (ii) an increase of the ratio between the wave and nonlinear times, with a critical ratio of $\chi$c\~{}1/3, (iii) a modification of the isocontours of energy revealing a transition from a purely perpendicular cascade to a cascade compatible with the critical-balance-type phenomenology, and (iv) an absence followed by a dramatic increase of the communication between Alfv{\'e}n modes. The changes happen at approximately the same transition scale and can be seen as manifest signatures of the transition from weak to strong wave turbulence. Furthermore, we observe a significant nonlocal three-wave coupling between strongly and weakly nonlinear modes resulting in an inverse transfer of energy from small to large scales.},

In slow solar wind, the decorrelation time is 215 {\textpm} 43 min, and in fast solar wind, the decorrelation time scale is 114 {\textpm} 23 min, which indicates that decorrelation times vary with the nature of the turbulence. The values reported here are comparable to estimates of decorrelation times based on a number of different models, but do not clearly support or refute any specific solar wind turbulence model.

This leads to an estimate that makes the r.m.s. value of du/dt of order \$({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}3/{\textbackslash}nu){\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac14\$. The Eulerian frequency spectrum, however, extends to higher frequencies than its Lagrangian counterpart; this is caused by spectral broadening associated with large-scale advection of dissipative eddies.

	abstract = {To understand the turbulent generation of large-scale magnetic fields and to advance beyond purely kinematic approaches to the dynamo effect like that introduced by Steenbeck, Krause \& Radler (1966){\textquoteright} a new nonlinear theory is developed for three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible MHD turbulence with helicity, i.e. not statistically invariant under plane reflexions. For this, techniques introduced for ordinary turbulence in recent years by Kraichnan (1971 a){\textquoteright} Orszag (1970, 1976) and others are generalized to MHD; in particular we make use of the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian approximation. The resulting closed equations for the evolution of the kinetic and magnetic energy and helicity spectra are studied both theoretically and numerically in situations with high Reynolds number and unit magnetic Prandtl number.Interactions between widely separated scales are much more important than for non-magnetic turbulence. Large-scale magnetic energy brings to equipartition small-scale kinetic and magnetic excitation (energy or helicity) by the {\textquoteleft}Alfv{\'e}n effect{\textquoteright}; the small-scale {\textquoteleft}residual{\textquoteright} helicity, which is the difference between a purely kinetic and a purely magnetic helical term, induces growth of large-scale magnetic energy and helicity by the {\textquoteleft}helicity effect{\textquoteright}. In the absence of helicity an inertial range occurs with a cascade of energy to small scales; to lowest order it is a -3/2 power law with equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energy spectra as in Kraichnan (1965) but there are -2 corrections (and possibly higher ones) leading to a slight excess of magnetic energy. When kinetic energy is continuously injected, an initial seed of magnetic field will grow to approximate equipartition, at least in the small scales. If in addition kinetic helicity is injected, an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity is obtained leading to the appearance of magnetic energy and helicity in ever-increasing scales (in fact, limited by the size of the system). This inverse cascade, predicted by Frisch et al. (1975), results from a competition between the helicity and Alf{\'e}h effects and yields an inertial range with approximately {\textemdash} 1 and {\textemdash} 2 power laws for magnetic energy and helicity. When kinetic helicity is injected at the scale linj and the rate \${\textbackslash}tilde{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}V\$ (per unit mass), the time of build-up of magnetic energy with scale L >> linj is \$t {\textbackslash}approx L({\textbar}{\textbackslash}tilde{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}V{\textbar}l{\textasciicircum}2\_{\textbackslash}rm inj){\textasciicircum}-1/3.\$},

	abstract = {A recapitulation is first given of a recent theory of homogeneous turbulence based on the condition that the Fourier amplitudes of the velocity field be as randomly distributed as the dynamical equations permit. This theory involves the average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes and employs a new kind of perturbation method which yields what are belived to be exact expansions of third- and higher-order statistical moments of the Fourier amplitudes in terms of second-order moments and these response functions.In the present paper the theory is applied in lowest approximation (called the direct-interaction approximation) to stationary isotropic turbulence of very high Reynolds number. The characteristic wave-number \$k\_0 = {\textbackslash}epsilon {\textbar}v{\textasciicircum}3\_0\$ and Reynolds number \$R\_0 = v\_0 k{\textasciicircum}-1\_0 {\textbar}v\$ where v0 is the r.m.s. velocity in any given direction, $\varepsilon$ is the power dissipated per unit mass, and $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, are introduced. For \$R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac 13\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1\$ it is found that the inertial and dissipation ranges extend over wave-numbers k satisfying k0 << k << R0k0. The time-correlation and average infinitesimal-impulse-response functions of the Fourier amplitudes in these ranges are evaluated. They are found to be asymptotically identical and given by J1(2v0k$\tau$)/v0k$\tau$, where $\tau$ is the time interval.The energy spectrum in these ranges is determined by a non-linear integral equation, involving the time-correlation and response functions, which is suitable for solution by iteration. The solution is of the form E(k)/v0v = (k/kd) \${\textasciicircum}- {\textbackslash}frac 3 2\$ f(k/kd), where E(k) is the three-dimensional spectrum function \$k\_d = R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac 23\_0 k\_0\$ is a wave-number characterizing the dissipation range, and f(k/kd) is a universal function. In the inertial range, E(k) = f(0) ($\varepsilon$ V0){\textonehalf} \$ k{\textasciicircum}- {\textbackslash}frac 3 2\$, asymptotically. Theparameter f(0) can be obtained by quadratures, without solving the integral equation for E(k). Spectral energy transport throughout the inertial and dissipation ranges is found to proceed by a cascade process essentially local in wave-number space; the direct power delivered by all modes below k to all modes above k' >> k is of order $\varepsilon$(k/k')\$ {\textasciicircum} {\textbackslash}frac 3 2\$ if k and k' both lie within the inertial range. The mean-square velocity derivatives of all orders are found to be finite. For \$R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac 13\_0 {\textbackslash}gg 1\$ the skewness factor of the distribution of the nth-order longitudinal velocity derivative is found to have the asymptotic form \$A\_n R{\textasciicircum}-{\textbackslash}frac 16\_0\$ where An is a universal constant.The theory is compared with experiment and is found to be slightly better supported than the Kolmogorov theory. However, it is stressed that extreme caution must be exercised in interpreting the experimental evidence as support for either theory.An analysis is given of the relations between the Kolmogorov theory, Heisen-berg's heuristic theory, the analytical theories of Heisenberg and Chandrasekhar, the theories of Proudman \& Reid and Tatsumi, and the present theory.},

	abstract = {The nature of the interactions between different scales in magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is important for the understanding of the behaviour of magnetized astrophysical, geophysical and industrial flows in a turbulent state. In this paper, we review some recent results in the study of locality of interactions in turbulent flows and we address some of the questions that arise. We examine the cascade of ideal invariants in turbulent MHD flows by examining the transfer functions. We show new results indicating that the nonlocal behaviour of the energy transfer in MHD is the result of a correlation between the velocity and magnetic fields. This nonlocality disappears if we randomize the phases of the two fields keeping the hydrodynamic and magnetic helicities fixed. The cascade of magnetic helicity is also investigated, with special focus on the fate of the small-scale helicity and its coupling with the large-scale flow. These results have implications for dynamo action, in particular for the commonly used distinction between large- and small-scale dynamos. The long-range interactions that exist in MHD flows also raise the question of the existence of universality in MHD, both in the kinematic dynamo regime as well as in the turbulent steady state.},

	abstract = {Since 1960 the study of turbulence has been enhanced by developments in areas such as laser anemometry, powerful computers, digital data processing and theoretical methods from quantum physics. Turbulence is the archetypal non-linear, non-equilibrium problem of statistical physics; the fundamental problems of turbulence are still unsolved, but there is a growing interest in their solution. This book aims to look at fluid turbulence from the point of view of engineering science and physics to produce an integrated treatise on the nature of the physics of fluid turbulence as a universal phenomenon with a universal behaviour. It is designed for those who are new to the subject and also for those familiar with the more traditional branches of the study of turbulence but not with the usages of quantum physics. For the first group of readers, a concise summary of the theory and practice of turbulence up to about 1960 is given as an introduction. This is followed by a detailed analysis of modern (post 1960) turbulence theory, including rigorous formulation of the turbulence problem as an example of a non-equilibrium statistical system with strong coupling and the application of renormalized perturbation theory to turbulence.},

After reviewing the properties which make spectral (Galerkin) and pseudospectral methods particularly useful for incompressible turbulence simulations, we consider how well these methods carry over to the compressible case. Major obstacles exist in formulating algorithms using the Galerkin method. In spite of the presence of aliasing errors, the pseudospectral method can be used to write algorithms that conserve a number of important global quantities. Accordingly, we suggest pseudospectral forms for a polytropic MHD model. Finally, a pseudospectral algorithm for the ideal gas MHD model is suggested. This algorithm conserves energy in terms of the dynamical fluid variables and not, as is common practice, due to a separate energy equation written in conservative form.},

However, for modes for which the period of the inertial waves $\tau_\omega$ is faster than the turnover time $\tau_{NL}$ , a significant fraction of the remaining energy is concentrated in the modes that satisfy the dispersion relation of the waves. No evidence of accumulation of energy in the modes with $\tau_\omega$ = $\tau_{NL}$ is observed, unlike what critical balance arguments predict. From the time correlation functions, we find that for modes with $\tau_\omega$ \&lt; $\tau$ sw (with $\tau$ sw the sweeping time) the dominant decorrelation time is the wave period, and that these modes also show a slower modulation on the timescale $\tau$ NL as assumed in wave turbulence theories.

	abstract = {We study weak Alfvenic turbulence of an incompressible, magnetized fluid in some detail, with a view to developing a firm theoretical basis for the dynamics of small-scale turbulence in the interstellar medium. We prove that resonant 3-wave interactions are absent. We also show that the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan theory of incompressible, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence -- which is widely accepted -- describes weak 3-wave
turbulence; consequently, it is incorrect. Physical arguments, as well as detailed calculations of the coupling coefficients are used to demonstrate that these interactions are empty. We then examine resonant 4-wave interactions, and show that the resonance relations forbid energy transport to small spatial scales along the direction of the mean magnetic field, for both the shear Alfven wave and the pseudo Alfven wave. The three-dimensional inertial-range energy spectrum of 4-wave shear Alfven turbulence guessed from physical arguments reads
E(kz, kperpendicular) approximately
VAvLL-1/3kperpendicular-10/3, where VA is the Alfven speed, and vL is the velocity difference across the outer scale L. Given this spectrum, the velocity difference across lambdaperpendicular approximately kperpendicular exp -1 is vlambda (sub
perpendicular) is approximately
vL(lambdaperpendicular/L)2/3. We derive a kinetic equation, and prove that this energy spectrum is a stationary solution and that it implies a positive flux of energy in k-space, along directions perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Using this energy spectrum, we deduce that 4-wave interactions strengthen as the energy cascades to small, perpendicular spatial scales; beyond an upper bound in perpendicular wavenumber, kperpendicularL is approximately (VA/vL)3/2, weak turbulence theory ceases to be valid. Energy excitation amplitudes must be very small for the 4-wave inertial-range to be substantial. When the excitation is strong, the width of the 4-wave inertial-range shrinks to zero. This seems likely to be the case in the interstellar medium.},

This picture has been challenged by Yakhot, Orszag, and She [Phys. Fluids A 1, 184 (1989)], who studied forced turbulence by renormalization-group (RNG) methods. The analysis given in the present paper leads to the conclusion that (a) precise coherence between energy-range and inertial-range excitation is needed to inhibit sweeping effects; (b) in the case of randomly forced turbulence, this coherence is impossible and Tennekes{\textquoteright} picture is unavoidable; and (c) the RNG analysis does not demonstrate inhibition of sweeping; instead, it discards sweeping effects at the outset. To augment the present study, an advected passive scalar is examined by computer simulation. Sweeping effects on small scales survive even in the case of long-time advection by a frozen velocity field.

The results are based on a detailed analysis of three-dimensional numerical flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. The energy transfer functions, as well as the global and partial fluxes, are examined by means of different geometrical wave number shells. On the one hand, the transfer functions of the two conserved Els{\"a}sser energies E+ and E- are found local in both the directions parallel (k{\textbardbl} direction) and perpendicular (k? direction) to the magnetic guide field, whatever the B strength. On the other hand, from the flux analysis, the interactions between the two counterpropagating Els{\"a}sser waves become nonlocal. Indeed, as the B intensity is increased, local interactions are strongly decreased and the interactions with small k{\textbardbl} modes dominate the cascade. Most of the energy flux in the k? direction is due to modes in the plane at k{\textbardbl}=0, while the weaker cascade in the k{\textbardbl} direction is due to the modes with k{\textbardbl}=1. The stronger magnetized flows tend thus to get closer to the weak turbulence limit, where three-wave resonant interactions are dominant. Hence, the transition from the strong to the weak turbulence regime occurs by reducing the number of effective modes in the energy cascade.},

The similarity between two recent approaches to modelling of therandom electromagnetic field is demonstrated.

Recent observations from Yohkoh and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and a reanalysis of older observations from the Solar Maximum Mission, have led to important new results concerning the location, timing, and efficiency of particle acceleration in flares. These are summarized in the first part of the review. Particle acceleration processes are then discussed, with particular emphasis on new developments in stochastic acceleration by magnetohydrodynamic waves and direct electric field acceleration by both sub- and super-Dreicer electric fields. Finally, issues that arise when these mechanisms are incorporated into the large-scale flare structure are considered. Stochastic and super-Dreicer acceleration may occur either in a single large coronal reconnection site or at multiple {\textquotedblleft}fragmented{\textquotedblright} energy release sites. Sub-Dreicer acceleration requires a highly filamented coronal current pattern. A particular issue that needs to be confronted by all theories is the apparent need for large magnetic field strengths in the flare energy release region.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional numerical simulation is used to investigate intermittency in incompressible weak magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with a strong uniform magnetic field \${\textbackslash}boldsymbolb\_{\textbackslash}mathbf0\$ and zero cross-helicity. At leading order, this asymptotic regime is achieved via three-wave resonant interactions with the scattering of a wave on a 2D mode for which \$k\_{\textbackslash}Vert =0\$ . When the interactions with the 2D modes are artificially reduced, we show numerically that the system exhibits an energy spectrum with \$k\_{\textbackslash}bot {\textasciicircum}-3/2\$ , whereas the expected exact solution with \$k\_{\textbackslash}bot {\textasciicircum}-2\$ is recovered with the full nonlinear system. In the latter case, strong intermittency is found when the vector separation of structure functions is taken transverse to \${\textbackslash}boldsymbolb\_{\textbackslash}mathbf0\$ . This result may be explained by the influence of the 2D modes whose regime belongs to strong turbulence. In addition to shedding light on the origin of this intermittency, we derive a log-Poisson law, \${\i}t{\textbackslash}zeta\_p=p/8+1-(1/4){\textasciicircum}p/2\$ , which fits the data perfectly and highlights the important role of parallel current sheets.},

	abstract = {This article reviews recent studies of scale interactions in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The present-day increase of computing power, which allows for the exploration of different configurations of turbulence in conducting flows, and the development of shell-to-shell transfer functions, has led to detailed studies of interactions between the velocity and the magnetic field and between scales. In particular, processes such as induction and dynamo action, the damping of velocity fluctuations by the Lorentz force, and the development of anisotropies can be characterized at different scales. In this context we consider three different configurations often studied in the literature: mechanically forced turbulence, freely decaying turbulence, and turbulence in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. Each configuration is of interest for different geophysical and astrophysical applications. Local and nonlocal transfers are discussed for each case. Whereas the transfer between scales of solely kinetic or solely magnetic energy is local, transfers between kinetic and magnetic fields are observed to be local or nonlocal depending on the configuration. Scale interactions in the cascade of magnetic helicity are also reviewed. Based on the results, the validity of several usual assumptions in hydrodynamic turbulence, such as isotropy of the small scales or universality, is discussed.},

We present a study of the spatio-temporal behavior of turbulent flows in the presence of different restitutive forces. We show how to compute and analyse the spatio-temporal spectrum from data stemming from numerical simulations and from laboratory experiments. Four cases are considered: homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, rotating turbulence, stratified turbulence, and water wave turbulence. For homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the spectrum allows identification of sweeping by the large-scale flow. For rotating and for stratified turbulence, the spectrum allows identification of the waves, precise quantification of the energy in the waves and in the turbulent eddies, and identification of physical mechanisms such as Doppler shift and wave absorption in critical layers. Finally, in water wave turbulence the spectrum shows a transition from gravity-capillary waves to bound waves as the amplitude of the forcing is increased. Graphical abstract},
