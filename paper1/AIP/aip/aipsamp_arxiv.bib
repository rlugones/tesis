  Abstract                 = {The sharp magnetic discontinuities that naturally appear in solar magnetic flux tubes driven by turbulent photospheric motions are associated with intense currents. Parker proposed that these currents can become unstable to a variety of microscopic processes, with the net result of dramatically enhanced resistivity and heating (nano-flares). The electric fields associated with such "hot spots" are also expected to enhance particle acceleration. We test this hypothesis by exact relativistic orbit simulations in strong random phase magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that is forming localized super-Dreicer Ohm electric fields (10 2 ≤ E Ω / E D ≤ 10 5 ) occurring in 2%-15% of the volume. It is found that these fields indeed yield a large amplification of acceleration of electrons and ions and can effectively overcome the injection problem. We suggest in this article that nanoflare heating will be associated with sporadic particle acceleration.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in understanding of MHD turbulence call for revisions in the picture of particle acceleration. We make use of the recently established scaling of slow and fast MHD modes in strong and weak MHD turbulence to provide a systematic study of particle acceleration in magnetic pressure-dominated (low β) and gaseous pressure-dominated (high β) plasmas. We consider the acceleration by large-scale compressions in both slow and fast particle diffusion limits. We compare the results with the acceleration rate that arises from resonance scattering and transit-time damping (TTD). We establish that fast modes accelerate particles more efficiently than slow modes. We find that particle acceleration by pitch-angle scattering and TTD dominates acceleration by slow or fast modes when the spatial diffusion rate is small. When the rate of spatial diffusion of particles is high, we establish an enhancement of the efficiency of particle acceleration by slow and fast modes in weak turbulence. We show that highly supersonic turbulence is an efficient agent for particle acceleration. We find that even incompressible turbulence can accelerate particles on the scales comparable with the particle mean free path.},

  Abstract                 = {The ever increasing processing capabilities of the supercomputers available to computational scientists today, combined with the need for higher and higher resolution computational grids, has resulted in deluges of simulation data. Yet the computational resources and tools required to make sense of these vast numerical outputs through subsequent analysis are often far from adequate, making such analysis of the data a painstaking, if not a hopeless, task. In this paper, we describe a new tool for the scientific investigation of massive computational datasets. This tool (VAPOR) employs data reduction, advanced visualization, and quantitative analysis operations to permit the interactive exploration of vast datasets using only a desktop PC equipped with a commodity graphics card. We describe VAPORs use in the study of two problems. The first, motivated by stellar envelope convection, investigates the hydrodynamic stability of compressible thermal starting plumes as they descend through a stratified layer of increasing density with depth. The second looks at current sheet formation in an incompressible helical magnetohydrodynamic flow to understand the early spontaneous development of quasi two-dimensional (2D) structures embedded within the 3D solution. Both of the problems were studied at sufficiently high spatial resolution, a grid of 504 2 by 2048 points for the first and 1536 3 points for the second, to overwhelm the interactive capabilities of typically available analysis resources.},

  Abstract                 = {The acceleration of charged particles is relevant to the solar corona over a broad range of scales and energies. High-energy particles are usually detected in concomitance with large energy release events like solar eruptions and flares. Nevertheless, acceleration can occur at smaller scales, characterized by dynamical activity near current sheets. To gain insight into the complex scenario of coronal charged particle acceleration, we investigate the properties of acceleration with a test-particle approach using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. These are obtained from direct solutions of the reduced MHD equations, well suited for a plasma embedded in a strong axial magnetic field, relevant to the inner heliosphere. A multi-box, multiscale technique is used to solve the equations of motion for protons. This method allows us to resolve an extended range of scales present in the system, namely, from the ion inertial scale of the order of a meter up to macroscopic scales of the order of 10 km (1/100th of the outer scale of the system). This new technique is useful to identify the mechanisms that, acting at different scales, are responsible for acceleration to high energies of a small fraction of the particles in the coronal plasma. We report results that describe acceleration at different stages over a broad range of time, length, and energy scales.},

The natural tendency of turbulent MHD fields is to form current sheets along the magnetic field direction, as well as strong nonuniform fields in the transverse directions. By associating the MHD dissipation length scale with the ion inertial scale, we found differential energization in parallel and perpendicular directions according to the type of particles considered. Electrons develop large parallel velocities, especially in current sheets. Protons instead show higher perpendicular energization due to the nonuniform perpendicular induced electric field produced by the plasma MHD velocity, which varies on proton length scales. Implications for dissipation mechanisms in a coronal heating model are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the effects of pitch-angle scattering on the efficiency of particle heating and acceleration by MHD turbulence using phenomenological estimates and simulations of non-relativistic test particles interacting with strong, subsonic MHD turbulence. We include an imposed pitch-angle scattering rate, which is meant to approximate the effects of high-frequency plasma waves and/or velocity space instabilities. We focus on plasma parameters similar to those found in the near-Earth solar wind, though most of our results are more broadly applicable. An important control parameter is the size of the particle mean free path λ mfp relative to the scale of the turbulent fluctuations L . For small scattering rates, particles interact quasi-resonantly with turbulent fluctuations in magnetic field strength. Scattering increases the long-term efficiency of this resonant heating by factors of a few times 10, but the distribution function does not develop a significant non-thermal power-law tail. For higher scattering rates, the interaction between particles and turbulent fluctuations becomes non-resonant, governed by particles heating and cooling adiabatically as they encounter turbulent density fluctuations. Rapid pitch-angle scattering can produce a power-law tail in the proton distribution function, but this requires fine-tuning of parameters. Moreover, in the near-Earth solar wind, a significant power-law tail cannot develop by this mechanism because the particle acceleration timescales are longer than the adiabatic cooling timescale set by the expansion of the solar wind. Our results thus imply that MHD-scale turbulent fluctuations are unlikely to be the origin of the v –5 tail in the proton distribution function observed in the solar wind.},

Spatial intermittency is generally associated with formation of sharp gradients and coherent structures. The basic physics of structure generation is ideal, but when dissipation is present it is usually concentrated in regions of strong gradients. This essential feature of spatial intermittency in fluids has been shown recently to carry over to the realm of kinetic plasma, where the dissipation function is not known from first principles. Spatial structures produced in intermittent plasma influence dissipation, heating, and transport and acceleration of charged particles. Temporal intermittency can give rise to very long time correlations or a delayed approach to steady-state conditions, and has been associated with inverse cascade or quasi-inverse cascade systems, with possible implications for heliospheric prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {We calculate quasi-linear transport and acceleration parameters for cosmic ray particles interacting resonantly with undamped fast-mode waves propagating in a low-β plasma. For super-Alfvénic particles and a vanishing cross-helicity state of the fast-mode waves, we demonstrate that the rate of adiabatic deceleration vanishes, and that the momentum and spatial diffusion coefficients can be calculated from the Fokker-Planck coefficient D μμ . Adopting isotropic fast-mode turbulence with a Kolmogorov-like turbulence spectrum, we demonstrate that D μμ is the sum of contributions from transit-time damping and gyroresonant interactions. Gyroresonance refers to | n | ≠ 0 resonant particle-wave interactions. Transit-time damping refers to the n = 0 interaction of particles with the compressive magnetic field component of the fast-mode waves. We show that transit-time damping provides the dominant contribution to pitch-angle scattering in the interval ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} ≤ | μ | ≤ 1, where ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} is the ratio of Alfvén to particle speed. In the interval | μ | < ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} , transit-time damping does not occur, and gyroresonance provides a small but finite contribution to particle scattering. As a consequence, the momentum diffusion coefficient is mainly determined by the transit-time damping contribution. On the other hand, since the spatial diffusion coefficient and the related mean free path are given by the average over μ of the inverse of D μμ , these spatial transport parameters are determined by the contribution from the interval | μ | < ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} . We also calculate the cosmic ray transport parameters for plasma turbulence consisting of a mixture of isotropic fast-mode waves and slab Alfvén waves. Here, the momentum diffusion coefficient is determined by the transit-time damping of the fast-mode waves, and is a factor ln ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} -1 larger than in the case of pure slab Alfvén wave turbulence. The mean free path and the spatial diffusion coefficient are modified significantly from the pure fast-mode case, since the crucial scattering at | μ | < ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] {epsilon} is now provided by gyroresonances with slab Alfvén waves. The mean free path is a constant at nonrelativistic energies, and may account for the legendary λ fit -λ QLT discrepancy of solar energetic particles.},

  Abstract                 = {Pitch-angle scattering rates for cosmic-ray particles in MHD simulations with imbalanced turbulence are calculated for fully evolving electromagnetic turbulence. We compare with theoretical predictions derived from the quasilinear theory of cosmic-ray diffusion for an idealized slab spectrum and demonstrate how cross helicity affects the shape of the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient. Additional simulations in evolving magnetic fields or static field configurations provide evidence that the scattering anisotropy in imbalanced turbulence is not primarily due to coherence with propagating Alfvén waves, but an effect of the spatial structure of electric fields in cross-helical MHD turbulence.},
