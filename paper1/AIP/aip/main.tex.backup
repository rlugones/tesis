\title{Compressible effect on particle acceleration in MHD turbulence}

\begin{abstract}
\noindent The compressibility effect of the magnetohydrodynamics fields  on charged particle 
energization is studied in the context of test particle simulation. This problem is relevant 
to solar wind and solar corona due to the compressible nature of those astrophysical 
scenarios. We obtain the turbulent electromagnetic field using direct numerical simulation 
of MHD equations in a strong background magnetic field using pseudospectral method.  
In order to explore the compressible effect over the particle dynamic we performed two 
different numerical experiments: the incompressible case and two weak compressible cases 
changing the sound Mach number: for $M=0.25$ and $M=0.1$. Analyzing  the behavior of protons and 
electrons in that turbulent field which is well known to form aligned current sheets in the 
direction of the guide magnetic field,  we show that compressibility enhance the efficiency 
of proton acceleration and that energization is due to perpendicular electric field 
generated between currents sheets. On the other hand, electrons remains magnetized, showing 
an adiabatic behavior, and not effect of compressibility is observed.
